It reads like a memoir. I am reluctant to give you even a short plot summary as I think it reads best if you know very little about it. I read it in two days--just couldn't put it down! Emma Donoghue is a master story teller. These are real characters that become heart-wrenching real people. Jack is not a \"cutesy\" 5 year old, he comes across as an intelligent, imaginative and curious little boy despite his many obstacles. This is a MUST read for all parents, grandparents and anyone interested in the the amazing resiliency of humans. Absolutely a great book.

9c0cc4ac46e1e735d0537944ac01ef7c,33021867,Operation Hail Storm,2882940,Brett Arquette,b66c530d1bf8e12ddc9d2e741efbab27,5,"I received this book directly from the author in exchange for a review. 
 Wow, how best to approach a book that I found both amazing and yet amazingly frustrating? Let me begin by saying I loved this book. Any \"criticisms\" are intended more as advance warning to potential readers of the things that I found difficult, but in no way does anything detract from what I think is an amazingly well-told story. 
 First, the author approached me because I enjoyed \"The Killing Floor\" by Lee Child, a Jack Reacher novel. In no way, shape or form is Operation Hail Storm like The Killing Floor in terms of plot. If I were to compare, it is far closer to Tom Clancy's \"The Hunt for Red October\" with a little Robert Ludlum's Bourne novels mixed in. The author is slavish in his attention to the technical details. As I have a strict attitude toward spoilers, none will be given but do NOT approach this novel as a light read. Mr. Arquette goes into extreme detail on the minutiae of the central premises of the story. Readers who are lost in such details will struggle terribly with this novel. 
 The novel, as I read it, consists of four episodes: The opening, in which we meet Marshall Hail as he executes a plan which sets the entire novel's plot into motion. In the process, we meet much of Hail's team and get a sense of the nature of the story itself. The second episode introduces the reader to the female lead, Kara Ramey, and sets the end-narrative in motion. Put another way, while the opening is important, it is an ancillary episode to the main story. The third episode brings Kara and Marshall together, establishes the nature of their relationship very effectively, and opens the door to the fourth and final episode. If I am going to say there is something that the author does extremely well, it is establish scene and character. His attention to detail extends beyond the technical. While we are teased early in the narrative with references to The Five, the author fleshes out this arc and, in much the same way Ludlum did with Bourne, give Marshall Hail a powerful history and Kara's motivations have far more definition than I would have imagined. 
 Characters are too numerous to catalog, so I focus mostly on Kara and Marshall. Marshall's supporting cast is magnificent in their skills and personalities. Kara's, on the other hand, seem rather \"linear.\" Largely government officials, they function mostly as half-antagonists to the end-game for Marshall and his team. Trust, when you read this novel, you do not love the officials in Washington. But Kara is an exercise in writing a female character. She is the \"sexy spy\" but has more depth than that implies. Much of her appeal to me comes after her introduction, when she is interacting with Marshall, as she tries to play \"spy-games\" with him and....well, its a well-choreographed set of interactions. Marshall, as befits the title character, is a man on a mission, and the reader is left to decide if that mission makes him a hero or a threat to the nation. But here I would be remiss if I omitted the paragraph I wrote for this review when I was a third of the way through this novel. 
 A special mention must be made that I believe the author has made the \"tech\" a character unto itself, a character who only speaks through actions and descriptions perhaps, but a character nonetheless. Entire pages of e-text are dedicated to almost loving descriptions of servos, batteries, weight ratios, technical jargon, and the artistry of their functions. If I had to equate this \"character\" to the work of another author, it would have to be Tom Clancy, who did much the same in his Jack Ryan novels as well as the Rainbow Six narratives. Readers who are easily mired in excessive detail would be well-advised to use caution when reading this novel as a result. 
 Would I recommend this novel? Wholeheartedly. Marshall Hail is a technophile's dream character. What makes him so delightful is, in my opinion, the way he compares to other author's masterpiece characters. Jason Bourne, Jack Reacher, Jack Ryan, James Bond, and now Marshall Hail are characters who are not perfect, nor should they be. They are broken men who have a purpose. The reader is taken along on a journey with them, and I thoroughly enjoyed going with Hail, and hope for an opportunity to see where he goes next.",eng,21,Mon Jan 30 17:59:47 -0800 2017

 My Opinion: The story of Cassia, Ky, and Xander is a complex mix of the influence of government/society and our personal choices. In this finale of the Matched series, each character had to decide if they should trust society, the Rising, the Pilot, or themselves. I loved the conflict here. 
 The mystery of Cassia's \"red garden day \" intrigued me and I was impressed how it all came together by pulling bits and pieces from the previous novels. Sometimes you read a series and you wonder if the author knew the ending before she began. In this series, everything seemed to come full circle and clues from books 1 & 2 turned out to be important. 
 The book was a little longer than I think necessary, but I honestly can't think what I would have cut out. I loved the beauty in the descriptions and the thoughts of each character. I'm excited to see what Ally Condie brings us next.

9232d7c139121a95a67df00230fb59e3,9030,"The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic and Madness at the Fair that Changed America",5869,Erik Larson,a3ebf0d46b5ec9e5fa19230be556da94,5,"After East-End Jack, the only other Victorian serial killer people could name would probably be H.H. Holmes. The curious American doctor who built a crazy house in Chicago with gas chambers, hidden rooms and a furnace too big and too powerful for domestic use. So it's somewhat bizarre that even though Holmes was caught and tried and executed, there's something quite unknowable about him. We know who he was, but the why, even the how a lot of the time, remains an utter mystery. 
 At the time the fact that such a man existed wasn't bloody grist to the mill of Sunday Magazine Supplements. There was not only a feeling that the gory details should be kept away from the general public, but a move even to limit the scope of the enquiry. We have no idea how many people he killed. His case was never fully examined in a court of law, as if his evil - if exposed - would turn out to be contagious. 
 These days the media would have more than a feeding frenzy, it would be - I don't know - a devouring delirium. No detail, regardless of how small, would be ignored. All, from the brand of toothpaste he used outwards, would be given a sinister spin. There's evidence here that there was a certain amount of that appetite already there, but from a 21st century perspective one can't help but be amazed at how restrained the 19th century versions of us actually were. 
 We've obviously performed a high-speed 180 since the late Victorian era, to the extent that true-crime fiction of today generally and justifiably gets a bad press, because a lot of it is just there to be salacious and to titillate man's desire for darkness. It's the outer edge of the tabloidisation of society. 
 THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY is the upper end of the scale though, a world away from those tawdry paperbacks with bloody knives on the cover. It's smart, beautiful gripping, page turning with a fine sense of history. 
 I did wonder, as I started reading, whether the decision to alternate Holmes's story with the contemporaneous design and construction of the World's Fair in Chicago would prove to be a wise one. After all, surely a serial killer is going to be far more fascinating than a bunch of architects sat in smoky rooms arguing. But Holmes is such a cypher in his own story that he really does take the idea of the banality of evil to a whole other level. We hear about his charm and mesmeric effect, but - boy! - he seems boring. As such Larson has to do the heavy lifting in the other side of the narrative, and really does take the architects' story and make it really grip. So much so that I was actually rooting for plucky Chicago to find a statement piece that would live up to the previous fair's Eiffel Tower. 
 SPOILER ALERT: They did and it was called The Ferris Wheel. 
 The fact that this book could make me care about the ins and outs, ups and downs of a construction project a hundred plus years back and thousands of miles away - so that it almost seems more interesting than a deadly, notorious serial killer - just shows that this book is practically a work of genius. 
 Not tawdry, not sensationalist, instead narrative history at its definite best.

d75ced78a64d5eaf8ab9c4ed0707c345,958649,Honor Bound,6218,Sandra Brown,2e3b603c107e84fccfd7ac1771e26e7e,3,"Honor Bound was an okay read. Nothing exciting or that great about it so I wouldn't really recommend running to go read it. The hero was Native American (\"Indian\") and he never lets the heroine or the reader forget it. He thought the whole while world was out to get him, which got a little old after awhile. Here is a synopsis of the story: 
 Lucas Greywolf was sent to prison for 3 years for staging a Native American rally that got violent and ended with police officers seriously injured. So he got sent to prison for 3 years even though he wasn't involved in the fight (yeah right). He escapes jail (we are never given the details of this miracle) because he wants to see his grandfather before he dies. Aislinn Andrews finds Lucas in her home after he broke in to find some food. He takes her hostage and forces her to take him to his grandfather's house in her car. He is pretty mean to her but doesn't physically harm her. Once there, he gets to see his grandfather for a few hours before his death. Aislinn feels sorry Lucas and they make love right before the police show up and send him back to prison. 
 Nine months later, Lucas is released from prison and goes to Aislinn to thank her for not telling authorities he kidnapped her. Once there, he finds out she had a son as a result of their love making. He threatens her with all kinds of things to try to make her marry him and move to the reservation with him. She doesn't give in right away, not until her parents show up and try to get her to give Lucas her son because they don't want her to be an unwed mother. So Aislinn decides to marry Lucas and move away with him to his horse ranch. This is where the story started to annoy me because Lucas treated her like crap despite the fact that she was always nice and considerate of him. He was \"afraid of love\" and didn't want to love a white girl (hello? he was a half-breed with a white father!). He is only sort of nice to her once or twice in the whole book, the only thing we are sure of is that he wants to sleep with her. They eventually work things out and he thaws a little bit in his attitude toward Aislinn. The only thing in the positive for him was that he loved his son right away. 
 Lucas was a typical 80's hero, a hard man who treated the heroine coldly because he didn't want to love her. Parts of the story were interesting, I like kidnapping plots. The book could have been better if long time periods weren't glossed over and more detail would have been given on the characters actions and feelings. So overall, an average read with an interesting plot idea that wasn't executed as well as it should have been and a hero that needed to lose the huge chip on his shoulder.","",5,Tue Oct 14 05:24:53 -0700 2008

 I do wish that Ellis included MORE of her life and herself in the book, which is basically a really long literary analysis. Fun to read, but if it had been more personal, I would have been more engaged. 
 Overall though, I'd recommend this to any woman (or any person) who is an avid reader and wonders why they read. Ellis makes a case for the value of fiction, which is important.

 The door does not open. 
 Sarah places her ear against the wooden surface and strains to hear Mattie's footsteps inside., hear the creaks her barely one hundred pounds would make. But the baby's cries do not allow for that. 
 Sarah kicks at the door and beats it with her fist, beats it hard. \"I mean it, Mattie. I ain't no Mama. You his Mama. Bet he's got your dimples. Now come get him. Come get him now!\" 
 Mama Bone is a beautiful title for the story about a woman named Sara Creamer who is left to care for the child, a product of an affair between her husband and her dear friend, Sister Mattie. She doesn't have 'one good mama bone' according to her own mother, and yet she has no choice but to come and answer the cries of the abandoned baby. In poverty, she must scramble to raise Emerson Bridge when her husband dies in shame, unable to work, a drunk. With nothing to feed her son, desperation clings. There is shame in her heart that she doesn't feel good enough as a mother, she isn't his real Mama. She let the loving, come from Harold Emerson is HIS child, Sara doesn't feel worthy, she can't find the natural mothering bone. Her attempt to make a dress with fine material in the hopes of selling it to Luther's wife is a gamble, but she is desperate to put food in her boy's belly. Watching her sell is cringe worthy, as much as seeing her steal some food. That is what a real mother does! Sara, a heathen woman who doesn't go to church, daring to make dresses for Mrs. Dobbins, and now wanting a steer? The nerve! 
 The only way to feed her son, and pay off debts is to win a competition (Fat Cattle Show and Sale) by purchasing a baby steer from Luther Dobbins. He will come to be their nemesis, as he hungers to keep the champions in his own family with his son LC in the competition. Surely this poor woman isn't a threat, right? Certainly Sara has no clue what she is doing, nor how to feed the steer but Mama Red is going to come crashing into their lives and back into her baby. Through this animal love, the inborn hunger for the cow to protect and shower her baby with love, Sara will learn how motherly love is measured. The reader also understands through Luther, what love is not and how hunger for always winning can diminish a child. Ike Thrasher is a vital character too that comes into Sara and Emerson's life, dragging his own terrible past behind him. He wants to help, to be worthy.. it's interesting how so many characters are trying to reach for worthiness in the eyes of their family, how parents can blindly make their children feel they will never measure up, sometimes with horrific consequences. 
 While this is about a rural town, the characters are not living simple lives. The novel begins with blood and may well end with it. Everything that happens in between leads to heartbreaking misery and beauty, a strange combination. We are often in our own way, and destroy that which we love. Sara is more than forgiving of others, a shame it takes so long to forgive herself for not being Emerson's 'biological' mother, for not realizing she loves him as much as any mother could love a child they birthed. She doesn't blame the child for his origins, and she steps up in spite of feeling she isn't mother material, shamed he may feel unwanted after-all, his mother rejected him and Sara's own words after his birth were, \"I don't want him.\" But as Emerson comes of age, he is such a wonderfully sweet endearing boy that who couldn't love him like a son? Sara is such a beautiful soul, the wounds to her pride, church going or not, she makes right from the start in mothering Emerson. Then there is LC, whom is pressed to hate Emerson, but just doesn't- a child can move beyond their parent's hateful ways. LC and Emerson should be the best of friends, the boy at heart is more a man than his father ever will be. \"His father had called them heathens for being unchurched, but LC knew better. He'd felt their hearts. And in his few short years of life, he already knew that's where all truth lies.\" So let not the reader ignore the strength in the awful Luther's son, LC. 
 Not all love stories are romantic, some are the love between a mother and her child. One Good Mama Bone moved me as a mother, because there are moments in any mother's life (biological or not) that we just don't feel we're are as good as we can be, that we are hurting our children for being a flawed creature. But that is the very thing that makes us human, we are imperfect. The terrible cruelness of Sara's own mother in itself is an example, an example of what is lacking, of who not to be. There is always something to learn from any mother. This is quiet southern fiction at it's best, it requires the characters to grow, but will all of them learn before it's too late? Some, but not all.

33786f1f8a7872b1cf1d9207d7ba4716,114583,The Sea,91,John Banville,5cb775fee46b5fbe1fc09423da0734f1,5,"Like many of Banville's books, The Sea presents itself to the reader as a fictional document penned by the narrator that alternates the present with the past. This narrator likes to drink, has a hard-on for fine art even though he has failed to establish a name for himself in this principal passion, has fallen on hard times, and makes a fetish out of descriptions of the effect of light. (One wonders if Banville keeps track of all the things he's illuminated, and the things he's compared them to, so that he doesn't repeat himself.) This is definitely Banville territory, but where, I wondered, were the scoundrels, murderers and pederasts? 
 The prose is dense, the pace is slow, and the characters are exceptionally timid people -- a spinster daughter, a consumptive Army colonel, a widower who drinks too much -- each more unsympathetic than the last. Banville's protagonists are always massively flawed men, but we permit the paragraphs about oil paintings or the way a patch of light shimmers on the floor because they are digressions. These are men who do things. Granted, they are nasty, rotten things, but they are very efficient as conflict-generating machines. The Sea's narrator is all the more loathsome because he has done nothing with his life and doesn't aspire to change. No plot, no conflict, no drama. I was convinced Banville's fourteenth novel was nothing more than a memory experiment gone awry, chugging sluggishly to nowhere. 
 Then, halfway through the novel, everything changes. The phantom plot materializes and asserts itself in a way that makes you realize it was there all along, buried in the now essential digressions. The characters crackle with acrimony, the relationships become increasingly adversarial, all of which distracts the reader from a plot turn so startling, fresh and - yes, epiphanic - it's impossible to see it coming. The accumulation of detail reaches a kind of critical mass that transforms the narrative into something utterly new. The Sea is to the short novel what \"The Dead\" is to the long short story. I was blind not to have seen it sooner; thankfully, the judges of the Booker Prize were not.

 Kitap gercekten keyif alinasi ve cok guzeldi. Yazar sonlarda bir yerde -olamazsa amanin olmaz- keske oyle yazmasaydin dedirtse de ayirdiginiz vakte kesinlikle degecek bir sekilde yazmisti. Kitap sonuna kadar iki erkek arasindan biri favorim olur desem de sanirim secimim diger kitaba kaldi. Cunku ben ikisini de aldim gitti valla! :D 
 Kitabimizin anlattiklarina da bakalim biraz: 
 Kitabimiz, kizimiz Celaena'nin mahkum tutuldugu cehennemden kralin yaveri icin yapilacak yarismada yahsi prensimiz Dorian'i temsil etmeyi kabul etmesiyle baslar. Cunku hapis tutuldugu yer berbattir ve anlasma ona puruzler cikarsa da ozgurlugu icin umut da vadetmektedir. Boylece kizimiz dusman oldugu, hapse dusmesine neden olan ve daha bircok kotulugune maruz kaldigi kralin yaveri olmak icin saraya gider. 
 Saraya gider ama aslinda hicbir sey dusundugu kadar kolay olmayacaktir. Zira o cehennem gibi hapisten sonra saray hayati, Yuzbasi Chaol'dan alacagi egitim ve bir nebze ozgurluk onu hapishanede gecirdigi zamanda kaybettigi forma kazandiracak olsa da gercek de gorunenden fazlasi ve daha zorlu seyler vardir. Ve bazi seyler de dikkatli olmazsa olumune neden olabilir. 
 Tabi tum bunlarin yaninda bir de iki dunya yakisiklisi erkegimiz var ki sec begen allik degil, direk ikisini de aliyimlik :D Biri prens -Dorian- digeri tum muhafizlarin basi -Chaol-! Ehh, Celaena da bir suikastci ;) Ki bunlar daha buzdaginin gorunen kismi. Daha surusuyle eglenceli, gizemli ve oldurucu karakter barindiriyor kitabimiz. Yani canin mi sikiliyordu? Oku da gor cumbusu sonra ne sikintisi. Zira kizimiz kimi secer, bu yarismada hayatta kalir mi, yoksa her seyden kurtulsa bile aslinda olaylar yeni mi baslar bilinmez??? Ya da bilinir de ben mi soylemem?? :) Sorular, sorular, sorular... Cevaplar icinse bu guzel kitabi alip okumaniz gerek. 
 Kitap turunun sinirlari icerisinde gercekten cok gercekci bir kitapti. Okurken keske yetiskinler icin yazilsa da o dovus sahnelerini bir de oyle okusam demedim degil. Gizem konusunda da yazarimiz basariliydi. Yazar sonunu tahmin ettirecek ipucular verse de bazi olaylarda hic beklenmeyen sekillerde sizleri sasirtabiliyor. Bu da okurken hem keyif almanizi hem de oldukca heyecanlanmanizi sagliyor :) 
 Beni en tatmin etmeyen kismi ise cevre tasvirleri oldu. Hele sato! Keske yazar anlatirken ustu kapali ya da kismen degilde tamamen hayalimizde canlanacak sekilde anlatsaydi. Tamam vakitlerin cogu orada gecmiyor ama sonucta havasi orada! Bunun disinda beni pek rahatsiz eden bir tarafi yoktu. Sadece sonlarda bir yerde -soylersem olmaz- klise tarzi bir olay oldu ve bu olmasa kitabi daha cok sevecegimi dusunuyorum. Beni bu kitapta rahatsiz etmese de belki sizi bazi yerlerdeki hizli gecisleri yorabilir. Onun disinda da bir sey yok zaten. 
 Karakterlerimize gelirsek, Chaol-Celaene-Dorian kendilerine ozgu ve birbirinden farkli, okumaktan zevk alacaginiz karakterlerdi. Kizimizin uyuz etme tavirlari, kisiligi ve hareketleri benim oldukca hosuma gitti. Oyle okuyup sinir eden turden biri degildi. Sonuna kadar tereddutsuz sevdigim bir karakter oldu. Prensimize daha en bastan vurulmustum zaten. Hele kizimizla ilk mektuplasmalari superdi! Chaol'a gelirsek, onu uzunca bir sure cok da sevemedim. Bana gore siradan biriydi. Aman dikkat, cunku kitabi bitirdigimde aslinda onu da sevdigimi ve ikisi arasinda karar veremedigimi gordum. Yani beyefendi hissettirmeden kendini sevdirenlerden ;) 
 Kitabimizin icinde bircok karakter ve coklu bakis acisi var. Bu da size hem zevk veriyor hem de biraktiginiz karaktere ne oldu sorusuyla merakta birakiyor. Daha fazla konusup kendimi kaybetmeden kesmem en iyisi olacak :D 
 Ama sunu demesem de olmaz, hani The Avengers filminin baslarinda Kara Dul yani Scarlett ablamizin bir sahnesi var. Once yakalanmis biri gibi rol keserken, birden pat! telefon calar ve bir konusma gecer. Daha sonra Kara Dul herkese agzinin payini verir ya. Hah! Kizimizdan da bir cogu yerde oyle bir performans bekledim ama ne yazik ki gelmedi. Neyse artik kismetse bir dahaki kitaba diyorum ;)",tur,2,Fri Feb 01 10:00:22 -0800 2013

He is doing everything he can to give his life a happy ending and just does not understand why his family and friends refuse to talk about his beloved wife Nikki. He understands that something happened and he is doing his best to make \"apart time\" be over. Pat is on a rigorous training routine to make his body physically fit for Nikki. He is trying to cope with being haunted by Kenny G. He is dealing with an apparent stalking by his best friend's sister-in-law. He is cheering for his beloved Philadelphia Eagles and trying oh-so-hard to be good. Why is everyone trying to make him think about things too? 
 Mr. Quick has written an amazing book. In an entertaining, well-written and kind way he has given his readers an insight into mental illness. Pat is definitely troubled and trying very hard to heal but the impact of mental illness goes so much further than Pat. It affects everyone around him as well. This is his story, but also the story of all the people around him. I have not seen the movie so do not know if it does the book justice, but the book was wonderful. Although very different style and content, this book reminded me a little bit of A Beautiful Mind with the awe and pride I felt for both of the main characters at the end of their stories.

 A little investigation later they realise that they have a big case in their hands. The body is of none other than Rak Mehta, President & CEO of a super-successful publishing company Indigo. What they discover at the Lotus resort where the Indigo team was putting up for their conference, they realise that nothing is as simple as it looks. 
 Besides the office politics there are grudges, rivalries, lies and the fact that Rak was one of the most hated people in company complicates the matter further. There are several suspects, each have solid reasons to murder Rak. 
 Niki and her super-efficient team get on with the task catch the killer before Sonargam's idyllic landscape is disrupted once again. 
 My Verdict 
 I have kept the story description at bare minimum because a good thriller is best read. Did I say good? Yes! I meant it. Set in a fictional town of Himachal Pradesh this books works for me at many counts 
 It has smart lines & smart writing 
 The characters are well etched, they are sharp and say all the right things and for me that is a major plus. I have always fallen over heels for smart talkers and the book won over me on that count. I especially liked the character of Niki's assistant, the internet savy Inspector Sahay! 
 The police for a change is not our stereotype police. Not that the ones described in this book are easy to find but then ultimately you can think good at least in fiction ;-) 
 The setting of the book is beautiful 
 Signs of a good mystery for me are when I am unable to guess the culprit correctly & when it skips all stereotypes and the book works on both the counts. For a change I was wrong as far as who-dun-it was concerned 
 The book is fast paced & doesn't give you much to think about. 
 Some little things that I didn't like about the book were, the authors attempt to make Niki's character a little on the lines of our usual chick lit protagonist. I mean ok 
 But all that does not take away the fact that the book is entertaining, fast paced and a good thriller. Waiting for more in the series to come :-)",eng,1,Tue Oct 09 09:08:55 -0700 2012

 I love this book...absolutely love it! Below is the author's blurb. 
 I'm forty years old, rich as hell, a bit of a control freak, and content with being single. She's twenty-two, a spoiled brat, and was practically left at the altar. She needs a therapist not a man who who could never give her what she's searching for. She doesn't need me.~~~The problem is I just might need her. 
 Isn't that a great blurb? It was a real kick of a teaser and I was so anxious to dig in. I actually put it off for a couple of days to let the suspense build while I finished a trilogy I was reading. But here's my problem. I read it Thursday evening before our three-day Easter holiday. It was on my mind for the entire three-day holiday and I simply can't begin another book...believe me, I've tried. I'm obsessed. I want to be the heroine of this story...badly. 
 My Plan: Tomorrow is Monday and while my two sons are at university beginning their finals I will be rereading this super book...and yes, I will be dreaming that I am the heroine. 
 Advertising executive Mateo Martel likes order and routines. He's moderately OCD but the author doesn't speak as to whether he has a formal diagnosis. I guarantee you he is. As a forty year old man, it is my opinion that he acts much younger than his age or at the very least he is definitely immature. He reminded me of young man in his early to mid thirties. That threw me a little but I adjusted quickly and mentally viewed him as a 32 to 35 year old. 
 Giselle Diaz is a 22 year old trust fund baby who has a father who gives her anything and everything she wants. He's not been a good father and gave money and gifts instead of time and attention. He wants to control his daughter so he threatens to take her trust fund away to get her to do as he wants. This is where the manipulation comes in on Giselle's part. She is used to manipulating him to get what she wants. Her fiance left her at the alter so to speak. She wasn't in love with him but agreed to marry him to tick her dad off. 
 Kudos To Ella Jade for the following reasons. 
 1) Our hero did not appear to be a man-whore. He had spent many years beginning and building his business not having time for a personal or social life. Love it when a book is man-whore free!! 
 2) There was no other woman/other man drama...Hurrah! 
 3) Upon meeting one another they had eyes for no one else and they didn't fall into bed immediately. It was not insta-love and it grew over time. 
 I definitely recommend this book.","",1,Sun Apr 16 20:37:28 -0700 2017

And I can understand the frustration that it might incur. Honestly, there are some things that I wish that I could have gotten his mother's perspective (the backstory, her abuse, and her inevitable suicide attempt . 
 But I feel like people are kind of missing the POINT of showing things from Jack's point of view. As a five year old, he gives us a much starker view of the world. And you learn a lot more about the transitions from him. His mother already lived in the world, she wasn't trapped forever, just a long time. 
 But Jack didn't know ANYTHING outside that little room. It was his entire world, a place where he felt safe, and then he was thrown into an entirely different situation, with people who didn't understand him at all. Even his mother had trouble realizing why he didn't think that the outside world was better. 
 The parts I loved best? Probably when people interacted with Jack with understanding. I LOVED the part when he talked to Officer Oh. I think it was such a great exchange between the two of them. She never got impatient with him, she always tried to talk to him in ways he would understand, tried to ask him questions so that he would know how to answer them. And the fact that the other office was so willing to give up on Jack and try something else just makes it that much more poignant. 
 I liked Jack and his Grandmother, too. She was patient, understanding, and while there were a few times she lost her temper with him, she tried to be patient. At one point, he won't play on the playground because there are other kids, so she takes him early in the morning, when no one is there, to try and get him acclimated to the outside world. 
 While Jack's manner of speech didn't particularly bother me, I could see where it could get annoying. Also, while I like seeing things from Jack's eyes, I don't think Donoghue was an AMAZING writer. Good, yes, I enjoyed the book, but I didn't have to rush to the end. I think that I kind of got bored of Room scenes before she intended me to, but inevitable it worked out ok. She didn't spend the whole time in Room, which is what I expected. 
 Honestly, I liked the book, but I can easily she where people would get annoyed with it. If you've read other books that have taken a weird POV, then I would pick this book up.",eng,0,Fri Mar 29 05:56:43 -0700 2013

Maybe my opinion is swayed because the author died before they were published. Maybe I'm just intrigued with the image of Stieg delivering these three HUGE volumes to his publisher (very strange to have all three of them written at once) and then collapsing with a heart attack. But whatever the reason, I am willing to forgive clunky dialog (reminds me of exchanges on Dragnet), confusing, unpronounceable names with unfamiliar symbols over the vowels, quick little deviations from the plot to make sure that us foreigners understand the political make-up of Sweden and some unresolved storylines (for god's sake what about the sister!!!!). 
 I finished the book wondering if the author planned to write more about his compact, socially awkward, sexually charged, heavily tattooed heroine. (Spoiler alert) For one thing, Lisbeth is still alive at the end of this book and Blomkvist is about to start up a relationship while just seeming to realize that he can't live without Berger.

 \"...there had to be unsaid things between husbands and wives, and he had learnt that, though these were the things that saved you, they separated you too.\" - John Campbell 
 The main character in Black Lake by Johanna Lane is not a person; it's a house. But the word \"house\" doesn't do justice to Dulough. A castle estate set on the Irish cliffs of the North Atlantic, Dulough is a concept. The Campbell family, father John, mother Marianne, and the children Katherine and Philip, live at Dulough (\"black lake\" in Irish). It has been in the Campbell family for 150 years. When funds run precipitously low due to, it seems, general lassitude on John's part, he does the unthinkable: he allows the government to run Dulough as a museum for tourists, which will pay for needed repairs to the property. In return, John receives a salary for the first time in his life and the government builds a small cottage for the family alongside the caretaker's cottage. When the \"upstairs becomes the downstairs\" neither is on sure footing. The ensuing turmoil allows the existing faults in all of these relationships to shift, with tragic consequences. 
 Fast forward six months: twelve-year-old Katherine Campbell finds herself locked in the top floor ballroom of Dulough with her mother Marianne. Marianne is the one with the key but she doesn't want to leave. She has, however, taken leave of her senses. 
 \"It was after the snow that the mother began to talk about the girl's brother as if he were still with them. One morning, as the girl did her lessons, her mother said, 'I'd like you two to have this finished by lunch.' 
 The girl's heart jumped. But it was a tiny word, two - a slip of the tongue, perhaps.\" 
 Moving back and forth in time, between an omniscient narrator and the members of the Campbell family, has the same result as a game of telephone. Each narrative includes the same ingredients, the same information, but the different perspectives become a disjointed truth. The character on whom the future of this family hinges is the last to speak. Marianne Campbell will fill in the blanks left by her children and an obtuse, ineffectual husband. 
 Black Lake is author Johanna Lane's debut novel. She grew up in Ireland and now makes her home in New York City. Lane is either an empath or else she remembers better than most how it feels to be a child. She is a genius at conveying both the brutal, inexorable logic and the free-association of a child's mind. \"The men were older than his father; they had deep lines in their faces. Like valleys, Philip thought. He imagined tiny glaciers settling into their skin, the ice cracking and expanding. They had been doing glaciated valleys in Geography.\" And this: \"He thought about the man who hadn't flinched when Mrs. Connolly poured tea on the back of his hand. He wouldn't have much tolerance for children who didn't do what they were told. Philip imagined the man pouring teapot after teapot onto his outstretched hands. And him not being allowed to flinch, either.\" 
 The Irish countryside is also a character in this tale, the environment wild and formidable, the atmosphere thick with foreboding. Lane also possesses a gift for description. \"The wind was already in the gardens, the tops of the trees bent as if they were straining to talk to each other and straining to hear.\" And this: \"A ring of yew trees encircled the churchyard, a sign that his family believed they were going to heaven. But the trees had the opposite effect. It was dark under their canopy, even in the middle of the day. The roots curled themselves into the graves and the branches twisted into the contortions of the wind.\" 
 Like all good Irish tales, the theme of social justice haunts the place. During her turn, Marianne, upon discovery of the family diaries John has hidden away, will tell you the history. 
 \"John had never thought of his family as privileged. They had lived in a grand house, yes, but they'd had no luxuries. And yet he realized now that he had been spoilt. He had been brought up to think that there would always be enough money, magically there, because people like them always had enough. It was unthinkable that they would have to compromise themselves to accept a job they didn't want, a job that might take them away from Dulough, a patch of Ireland they had a right to.\" 
 Black Lake is ready to inherit a place amid the long and strong tradition of family dramas set in the great Gothic homes of Irish history.

 In this book we meet Jassa Marizen and Vroe of Vialea. When this book opens up we find Jassa running from the police of the time on Earth. Because she has not found an Earth mate they wish to impregnate her and then when the baby is born take it from her. Being an orphan herself Jassa isn't willing to do this so she signs up for Celestial Mates. Now if she can just get to their ship she will be able to have what her heart desires most a mate and a baby that she can keep. What happens though when she finds out the planet she is going to isn't all she thought it would be? Will she run back to the familiar even though it has it problems or will she stay and fight? 
 Vroe knows that his plant is different then what Jassa knows but he is sure if he can just be with his mate he can show her the wonders of it. What happens is not something he suspects his firez is coming on faster than he thought. He believes that he will hurt his new mate if he touches her the way he wants so he distances himself as much as he can from her. This isn't something either or them want but what can he do? Will he open himself fully to his mate or will he drive a wedge between them that he isn't sure he can repair? 
 This is a great story about finding the perfect love for you and making sure that you fight for the right to keep it. This book has many twists and turns to it that I don't want to ruin for any other readier. So I will say this book will have you hooked from the first word to the very end.

 While Drew Karpyshyn follows the same structure laid out in the first Chaos Born book, he also mixes it up a bit and offers the reader a more focused and well rounded book. 
 In book one, we watched as individuals, driven by their own stories, came together to form a powerful group in the face of a growing enemy. And by the end of that book we saw the newly formed group defeat a powerful dragon, only to press on towards the greater threat that lay beyond. Here, in book two, we see much of the same but on a larger scale. In this offering Drew shows that to defeat the growing threat the small group must become a larger community. With that said, we watch as clans, tribes, and societies pick sides for the coming battle. But where book one focused on a small group coming together, and the story in book two involves larger groups joining the fight, Drew Karpyshyn has also decided to make the story more focused and has given us a more in-depth view of one of the main characters. 
 Norr, he was the big, burly, protector of the powerful Scythe in book one, but in book two he is the driving force for the main story. No longer a background character, or a crutch for Scythe's evolution, he becomes a powerful force in the groups dynamic. His journey is one that most will never have seen coming, a journey that will make the man a hero, a villain, a savior, and a martyr. And in the end, his journey will be the catalyst for the third installment. 
 Overall the second book is a vast improvement over the first. We watch as Drew Karpyshyn gets back to the core of what makes him a powerhouse writer, and find that his ability to delve into a character's soul is still a powerful tool in his control. 
 Here, there are no major complaints to report. Although the book could have used a little more balance between the good and evil sides of the larger tale, and a little more of a climatic ending, most will see that the second book offers quite a bit more than the first. The more focused tale, and the more edited length, makes the second book a better read than the first.

 Ross Gardiner is back in town after his divorce and making great strides in rebuilding his future. 
 Sabina Grey has spent most of her adult life trying to overcome a family tragedy that still governs every decision she makes. 
 With so many obstacles in their path, any type of relationship between the two seems completely impossible. And impossible really seems to be the order of the day. 
 The old adage \"two steps forward, one step back\" is really \"one step forward, three steps back\" in this second-chance romance that is steeped in over-the-top drama. The story is well-written with characters that have distinct and likable personalities. But, in saying that, the storyline seems to be a relentless string of obstacles and misunderstandings that becomes overwhelming after a while. With a number of sub-plots vying for attention, I was afraid to turn the page because I knew there was going to be something; something new, unwanted and/or unpleasant that would put another spanner in the works for Ross and Sabina. 
 With a non-cliffy ending, there were no loose ends and the storyline was tied up most satisfactorily. ~ Diane, 3.5 stars

 This is one of those reviews where I had to delete the first couple of tries. I don't want to just jump in with negativity. This book deserves more than that at least. It had solid writing, and a good plot line. 
 I loved the idea of the sister being secretly in love with the other sister's boyfriend, and the idea of small town meddling and gossip pushing people together who just aren't meant to be. I have a weakness for sexy firemen, and I love when things come together for a happily ever after. The twist at the end was pretty great. I saw it coming, but still, I liked the way it was written, and I loved who the hero actually was at the end. There were just a few things that just made me not love this book. 
 For one, there was not as much character depth as I wanted there to be. I heard inside their heads, knew what they were thinking, and still they felt very shallow. The small town gossips and meddlers were mentioned by name, and then thrown in when needed for a quick plot device, but they weren't characters all on their own. I felt almost intruded on when they stepped into the story, as if they didn't really belong there. I wish they could have been stronger characters. 
 This book was not at all bad, I enjoyed reading it well enough. It just wasn't great either, and that was disappointing because it wouldn't have taken much to push it over that line. ~ George, 3 stars",eng,4,Tue Jul 21 11:05:11 -0700 2015

2200416d7a01dd0c8880c5116d87eb7c,8015504,"Deceived (Star Wars: The Old Republic, #2)",32912,Paul S. Kemp,b8f07f959874a097014b25b99e1ba0d0,3,"\"Gritty, dark, real with a loving Sith - what's going on?\" 
 It would be nice to read a Star Wars novel that didn't either; tie in with the movies or games. Having played The Old Republic MMORPG at launch, I get this story. It really does two things, introduces the different types of classes to the reader/gamer (aka - Trooper, bounty hunter, Sith warrior, scoundrel etc) and also the main characters in the game. That being, Darth Malgus (Sith warrior), the Emperor, Satale Shan (Jedi Master) etc etc. From a literacy point of view, it must have been difficult to be creative and bring your own twist to such a novel, when you are hamstringed by the lore, canon and beyond that, a game. Having said that, Deceived ties in well with one of the trailers that was released before came out (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4iL5u...). The beginning is rather explosive. From then on however, the novel fades to smaller embers of that explosiveness. 
 This is one of four novels that represent the era of The Old Republic and the second I've read (the first being Raven). This was the first to come out in the series and possibly the most difficult to get into. Darth Malgus is so far removed from being the standard 'bad arse' Sith. He loves to much and doubts himself (much like Darth Scrouge from Revan which I've mentioned in that review). I'm not sure if there was a conscious effort to try and portray a different archetypal Sith, but it seems a trend that runs through this series. 
 The main story is centred around a Jedi Knight, called Arrya, who thirsts for revenge against Darth Malgus (I've not given anything away from the story itself, see the trailer copied and pasted above). It's rather amusing to seeing a 'caring' Sith and a bloodthirsty Jedi. A trend which seems to be fairly A-typical lately \"let's go full-circle\" sorta-thing. Then you've got Malgus hunger for power and conflict within his own order, something not unusual when a Sith. What didn't sit too well with me was his battle with his perceived weakness; love for someone else. Why would a Darth so openly show his weakness to his fellow Sith, especially in battle? Why show a weaken side of yourself for other to exploit? It didn't feel right to me, and felt very convoluted when Malgus's story progressed with his obsession with Eleena throughout the prose. 
 The final player in the 3-pronged tale is a very stereotypical-Star-War-y smuggler. A rogue, a spice runner and a nice guy. Hmm. It was a nice touch to see how he was with his daughter, but other than that - the usual lustful awkwardness with Arrya was rather amusing and clumsily handled in my opinion. 
 I've spent my time revealing my difficulty with the three-dimensional characters and potential issues with the 'isms' of those characters. What I enjoyed; well Malgus does have his moments \"I just want to watch the world burn\" when referring to the sacking of Coruscent. His easy dismal of his peers amused me - his directness, avoiding politics and subtleties and just coming out with what he wished to say - which was a good foil for some of his, detractors within the Sith order of hierarchy. Z-man (aka the smuggler) touching moments with his handicapped daughter showed a different persona from the generic character, which was a joy to read. The gritty environment almost made me feel dirty, Malgus with his clear distaste of anyone, Arrya wishing harm on other's and Z-man being a drug runner; it made me feel dirty, DIRTY! 
 This was a fairly good introduction into The Old Republic series of novels. Sadly it looks like there won't be any more in the future after the first four, as the game has flopped. There is such rich potential here for future content. After all The Knights of the Old Republic really started the pre-Skywalker era. Give it a try if you're interested in a different feel to the Star Wars universe.",eng,7,Fri Mar 07 08:28:34 -0800 2014
f1be7cf617cc77f7be573df5d650bba0,3491640,Moxyland,426034,Lauren Beukes,5672a5dbffcd62de847a96572e015a62,4,"The setting is Capetown in 2018, and if this is not an alternate history tale, technology and the growth of a corporate/government alliance will have to move very quickly in the next four years. Unfortunately this may not be an alternate history tale. Every technological innovation and fascistic development Beukes brings to her story is a plausible blend of the dreams we have of a fully wired world and a worst-case scenario for the same. 
 Beukes characters are mostly in their twenties and a mix of art school graduates, upwardly mobile corporate types, hackers, and minor league revolutionaries of the Merry Prankster variety. She moves them rapidly through a world where one's identity is completely tied up with a cell phone, and the worst that can happen to you is a police-enforced disconnect. Corporations operate as city-states and rule a strictly stratified society whose members find release in their drugs of choice. Her greatest accomplishment is the slangy, hipster lingo her characters speak, a argot the reader is expected to keep up with without a phrasebook to help things along. And it works. Even when I was vague on specifics I felt I had the gist of what was going on. 
 The issues her characters face are familiar from novels without sf settings. They need money from home; they have friends who might become lovers; they might sell out to corporate money; or, their move up the corporate ladder conflicts with their links to avant garde factions of society. The story if fun and slightly dangerous, but dystopian fiction being what it is, you see serious trouble ahead. There is this sobering exchange late in the novel 
 ...any action is justified when there is a terrorist threat.\" 
 \"You just have to create your own terrorists.\" 
 ... 
 And it makes perfect sense. The process has to be managed. Fear has to be managed. Fear has to be controlled.

She is the All-New Wolverine. She's currently working to fight off an assassin with aerial assistance from Angel. 
 Why oh why did I wait to read The All-New Wolverine? I mean I already thought Laura was awesome from her origin until now. Perhaps some of the misses swayed me or maybe it felt weird seeing her in Wolvie's colors. Whatever the reason, I was being a fool. I've read an least one issue of three of the other four X titles and this one is much better than the others. Laura is an extremely complex character who has lived a long life since she was raised from birth to be a weapon. She's kind of like Pinocchio because since her inception she has slowly become a real girl...as much of a real girl as she can be considering she has adamantium claws and a healing factor that just won't let her die. I also appreciated the use of humor in what would otherwise have been a serious and bloody issue. 
 One thing bothered me, but it has nothing to do with Laura. It has to do with the Black Vortex, the super mirror that made anyone who accepted it's power in a cosmic powerhouse. My issue is Angel looked in the mirror and was transformed, but unlike Cyclops, Iceman, and Beast he didn't give the powers back. So my concern is why is he now just a bright winged version of his prior self instead of being far more powerful than practically everyone on Earth? It will bug me if he, Kitty Pryde, and Gamora have still have the makeovers without the power. 
 All-New Wolverine is a must for any fan of Laura Kinney formerly known as X-23. If anyone wasn't a fan before, now is the time to jump on the bandwagon.",eng,15,Sun Feb 07 18:56:00 -0800 2016

 - The book is kinda slow, but I savored each word. It really isn't the plot that sucked me into the series, it was the characters! 
 - This is such a different kind of rebellion. It is so fresh and unique to see this kind of resolve. 
 - The love triangle is settled, but I'm not completely happy about it. I understand why it went down the way it did, but I'm still not happy. 
 - This book really made me take a deep breath and think. The gears in my head were turning the whole way through. It is kind of a somber ending. 
 - I enjoyed this book, but I think Matched is my favorite in the series. 
 - There are so many little things in the previous books that come back in this one. I must go back to read the trilogy over again to really get the connections. Some of the stuff is brilliant!! 
 - I love reading Utah Author books because things like Sego Lilies pop up, and I love that Sego Lilies play a big role in the story! Go Utah Heritage!! Random fun state fact: Sego Lilies are our state flower. 
 - The covers of the book are wonderful. They really represent Cassia's journey. I even think the covers kind of correlate with Cassia and her experience with each Society pill. 
 - I'd love to see a sort of prequel book about Cassia's Grandfather. It would be so interesting. 
 - The book is very well written. There were some really beautiful moments.","",0,Sat Jan 21 08:13:40 -0800 2012

2a5da95d22f40baa49c2ff99044b2a5d,18947,Jane Austen For Dummies,11389,Joan Elizabeth Klingel Ray,a69c6769ade7996aa20662ea916ed0ba,5,"This book gives a good overview of the life and times of Jane Austen in a crisp, clear, and engaging manner. It is well-organized and easy to read with illustrations and pictures where relevant, and includes a broad spectrum of subjects ranging from dancing, courtship and marriage in Regency times to authors who influenced and who were influenced by Austen. 
 There are very relevant examples from Austen's works under each topic, which makes it entertaining and understandable. The book also has discussion sections on Austen's books and film adaptations (up until 2006), and Ray does insert her views a bit here, thus breaking the instructional tone that books in the Dummies series sometimes tend to have. Initially, I was a bit skeptical on even reading a book from this series cover to cover, but I could not pass on a book by Joan Klingel Ray. Ray is a professor of English and was also the president of the Jane Austen Society of North America (JASNA) from 2000 to 2006. 
 The one thing I did not enjoy in this book was someone's inability to proofread. The book does contain a few minor errors, mostly grammatical. However, these are very minor and do not take away from the book, unless the reader is particularly picky about these things. 
 Overall, I heartily recommend this book both to the Austen newbie as well as to more experienced Janeites. However, be sure to have read all the six major works of Austen before you read this (in spite of the book telling you otherwise), as one cannot really write such a book as this without spoilers!

I went back and forth and I think I've finally made up my mind. All else aside, this one has definitely made me think about it more than any other has for awhile. 
 I really liked Jeanie. She was strong and fought for what she wanted in life. She didn't turn down a challenge and repeatedly stepping up to the plate She was fiercely protective of her daughter and was a \"do the right thing\" kind of gal. While her judgement of how to get the right thing done wasn't always spot on - the mistakes made her human. 
 Camden was a bit of an arrogant prick at the beginning. Confident in always getting his way and willing to pay whatever it takes to get it. He gets soooo much better as the book goes on. When he firsts offers the fake fiance/marriage of convenience type of contract I almost didn't want him to be the hero. He is one of the most dynamic heroes I've seen in a long time. He was a completely different person by the end of the story, but it happened in an incredibly natural and organic way that you didn't really notice until it slapped you in the face. 
 There are a couple side storylines to give the book some depth with both their families and some serious family drama, but I liked that it didn't get dragged into the romance every step of the way. It was just presented as a way to round out the characters and show a bit about why they were the way they were.
