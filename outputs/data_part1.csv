Risberg  Length: 10 hours, 50 minutes  Genre: Paranormal Fiction  Release Date: May 31, 2013  Rating: 3.5 out of 5 stars  * I received a free copy of this audiobook from the author in exchange for an honest review.  Two witches living in the same town several centuries apart.  It is the 1700s and Rachel Cox is the talk of the town. They say she is a witch and they whisper whenever she walks by. It is a terrifying time to be accused of witchcraft. Witch hunts and burning at the stake are common.  Amanda is a modern day white witch. She is grieving the loss of her husband Jake and is just starting to try to figure out how to live without him.  There has been talk locally about a satanic cult practicing in the area. When murders begin happening the residents of the small town are scared. And, as always, scared people act irrationally. They start looking for someone to blame and despite living there for ten years, they chose her as their target.  Amanda must decide whether to permanently leave the house she loves and abandon the townspeople to the evil in their midst or whether to stay and fight to protect the town despite their hatred towards her.  This is a story of good vs. evil, but is also a tale of prejudice and the fact that people tend to fear anything or anyone they do not understand.  The author does a terrific job of incorporating the supernatural into the modern world. She also weaves history with present day.  The narration of this book was not as good as I had hoped. Much of the delivery is in monotone and the different characters do not have distinct voices. The voice used for Rebecca's familiar (a mouse) was horrible and it was weirdly similar to the voice used for the character of Sebastian. However, there are stretches of time where the narration is very good. This is just a personal observation. I recommend listening to this book yourself and making up your own mind about the narration.  I rate this book as 3.5 out of 5 stars.

Set and written in the late 70s/early 80s. Shows its age in some ways, though the casual sexism of some of the characters does not go unanalyzed; in fact, it contributes to a picture of the role misogyny played in the crimes and the investigation of them.  Some of the psychological analysis feels quaint -- and a little too lengthy -- but generally feels like a realistic of the long, drawn-out process of investigation and trial for murder, without (very often) feeling too slow. In spite of its length, I genuinely wondered about the innocence of the main character til the end.

The minute I read one page of this book, I was hooked!- I wanted to go on and on- If life were only to read! I might not want to put this aside until the last page.Truth to be told, I was attracted to read this book as Indonesia, my country was told there.One of her sayings written on her travelogue I can recall is that people love it when they hear about their countries.. Her writing about Indonesia arouse my curiosity.  There are of course a few other reasons why I decided to pick this book ; the first reason was because I put a great passion for traveling, meeting new people, tasting different kind of cuisines, and feeling the culture shocks. I love traveling, only that I often don't have time to travel, and often I think of the limited budget. I have lived in Indonesia since I was born. Let's say I have had a job since I was 23. That means I could have bunches of opportunities to explore my own country- but I can't at least not yet. Having read her book,which I prefer calling it as a travelogue really moves me. Not only does it tell about cultures, but also it tells how beautiful friendship is, how small the world actually is.  Her travelogue to some countries mentioned above is indeed so great experiences to read and probably to encounter that I felt like being drawn into her journeys, feeling what she feels. At times, she is capable of making me laugh because of what she had experienced in her journeys. For sure, tears welled up in my eyes when I read some of the tragedy happened in her journeys.I am not sure what I would do, how I would feel if I were in her positions dealing with some shocking events all by myself- no one helps me. All of sudden, you become a very self-sufficient person, because you have to  I remember a proverb \" When you are in Rome, do like the Romans do.\" In my opinion, Rita does apply this when she meets people coming from different cultural background in different parts of the world she traveled to. As a result, it is the acceptance that you get from the people in a new country you travel to- a country that doesn't share the same language. And acceptance leads to a feeling-like-a-family relationship. In long run, it is an ever lasting friendship you will get; your life will be rewarded by a bliss.  Long before I finished reading her book, I thought to myself about serendipity. It seems to me that her life is full of serendipity. It seems to me that people come to her rather than she comes to people; maybe this happens because she wants to know people and it shows the way she acts, speaks. Please allow me to call this as \"Laws of Attraction\", I might be wrong. Having finished reading her book, I browsed the internet to know more about her; her life, passions, and point of view. And I smiled when I noticed she wrote something about Serendipity. I wrote about this serendipity things sometime ago, but sorry it is for contacts only.  In her journeys, Rita has met a lot of people, dealing with some Zapotecs, kwashiorkor children, some backpackers, complicated bureaucracy's and so on and so forth.  To top it off,if you are into more than just traveling ( exploring beautiful places) then, this book is a must-read book. This book is awesome, and I dare put five stars for Rita as she is a great storyteller as well. Go grab it! and prove it. If you love people coming from different cultures, speaking totally different languages than you do- you really have to read this book.  As always when I review on something, let me introduce you to the three adjectives describe the book;  1.Awesome  2.Touching  3.Surprising  Happy Reading fellows !

I love those kind of Gothic undertones through a book and as we're in the middle of winter, it's the perfect time to sit down under a blanket and devour it. I was really happy when I received this surprise book (yes, it doesn't take a lot to excite me) but external forces conspired against me to read this at the speed I wanted. The House Between Tides is a solid read and those who are fans of Kate Morton will particularly enjoy this tale set in the wilds of Scotland.  The story is told between two major timelines, that of Theo and Beatrice in the late 1880s and 1900s before shifting to Hetty in the present day. Theo marries Beatrice and they move to the rugged wilds of the Outer Hebrides for Theo to paint. It all sounds incredibly romantic until Beatrice starts to realise that Theo has some ideas that are rather...odd. Her new friendship with the Cameron family isn't that welcome. When Hetty arrives in the present day to the now overgrown, crumbling estate (can't you just picture it, all grey and spooky with a lone raven calling overhead?) she's introduced to the descendants of the family after being caught trying to break into her own inheritance. Very shortly after, she discovers there's a skeleton in one of the rooms, which kind of wrecks her plans to build a hotel on the island. But what's the mystery? Who is this mysterious person and what secrets of the past does it hide?  I must admit that I guessed the mystery fairly early on and did something I don't usually do - read the last chapter to confirm my suspicions. I probably shouldn't have though, because knowing that I was right took away a lot of the mystery. On reflection, I think I did it because the character of Hetty is rather dull. She lacks spark and is happy to be passive nearly all the time. I like my investigating heroines to be stronger, willing to buck a trend and ruffle a few feathers. I felt that Hetty just sailed through the whole thing without causing a ripple. I tended to skim few chapters a little bit more as I found the historical timeline of Beatrice and Theo much more engaging.  I always slowed down for the beautiful descriptions of the Hebrides - this is where Sarah Maine's writing truly excels, in the sense of atmosphere and putting the reader in no doubt about how moody and a little bit creepy the whole place is. The descriptions of Muirlan House were incredibly evocative, and I had shivers down my spine as Hetty entered the shell of the decrepit house for the first time.  While I liked this book, I felt that the parts involving Hetty were slow at times. However, it's a sound debut book and I'd be interested to see what Sarah Maine writes in the future.  Thank you to Allen & Unwin for the copy. My review is honest.  http://samstillreading.wordpress.com",eng,0,Sat Jul 16 20:27:50 -0700 2016,528

Sounds like my typical day. But in this case: one claims to actually know MORE than any human should.  The author is scott adams (who wrote the Dilbert comics apparently). It seems Scotty is a creative amateur philosopher - Does anybody really ever get to be a professional philosopher? Teaching doesn't count of course (those that can't do - often teach... Ouch!). Does publishing a story book count in the upper hierarchy of deep thinkers? Sure, why not!  Fun story. I dare you to find the flaws in it? I found many. (I don't think Scott minds - he seems to have a healthy sense of humor).  Scott poorly compares all religions. He barely comprehends the deity of Christianity --- which technically destroys the value of his entire story. Some great insights, but not understanding the nature of the Trinity leaves the Debris of this God not necessary: see, God already died; remember that Jesus moment on the cross?  _________________________  The challenge with this book and every OTHER religion (outside of Christianity) is that they basically repeat what the talking snake did in the Garden of Eden:  Genesis 3  1Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the LORD God had made.  He said to the woman, \"Did God actually say, 'You shall not eat of any tree in the garden'?\" 2And the woman said to the serpent, \"We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, 3but God said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'\" 4But the serpent said to the woman, \"You will not surely die. 5For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\"  This stories Guru claims: quote (pg. 44)  |The old man looked at nothing and said, \"we are God's debris.\"  Well, not exactly the same as being an enlightened deity knowing good and evil... but comically close. This book basically smacks of some twisty Buddhism. What doesn't nowadays? Everybody gets to be THE GOD except Jesus. People keep claiming that He never claimed to be God. (The Bible shows how He is God in every way. People just don't like it... Cause it interfere's with their divinity.) Or in the case of Islam: it interfere's with their heavenly virgin Houris concubines (kept guarded behind pavilions?) that DON'T get to be God. Any dude will give up being bits of god for that eternal lovefest.  Quote (pg. 54)  \"So, you're saying God blew himself to bits - I guess that was the Big bang - and now he's piecing himself back together?\" I asked.  \"He is discovering the answer to his only question.\"  \"Does God have consciousness yet? Does he know he's reassembling himself?\"  \"He does, Otherwise you could not have asked the question, and I could not have answered.\"  So that's the fun we got to work with. Deepak Chopra would love this crap. Probably be in his next book. I wonder if Oprah would object to being a broken chippy bit of god?  But every theologian and philosopher (as well as scientist) should try and read this book. It will challenge them in some fun areas. Adams came up with some great stuff. This one was rather insightful:  Quote: (pg. 76) Argument about validating scientific studies  \"If they tested him with controlled experiments and he repeatedly passed, I think they would conclude he had ESP.\" I said.  \"Your wrong. They would conclude that their tests were not adequately controlled and that more study needed to be done. They would say that extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. And they would keep testing until they either got a negative result or lost interest. No skeptic would take the chance of declaring someone to have ESP if there were any risk of later being proven wrong. Their cult does not promote that sort of risk.\"  This is very applicable. Basically Secular Evolutionary science at its most naked. It simply MUST be correct...or we'd have to rethink the Biblical account and supernatural Intelligent Design... and we can't allow that in the classroom.  Why believe in a Great Flood when we can believe in 3 Ice Ages? Mock one and make endless claims about the other --- even claims that Mars was once flooded. But NEVER allow for a Global Earth flood of Biblical proportions.  So you might as well read this book - it's FUN stuff. Might cause you to question some things you easily and blindly accepted. But like most skeptics: probably NOT. Don't want to upset YOUR CULT.",en-us,0,Sat Jun 04 21:03:08 -0700 2016,806

In my opinion, The Firebird isn't really a sequel and both books can be read and understood completely independent of each other, but it was nice to have the background from The Winter Sea. I really enjoyed reading Anna's story and seeing more of beloved characters from the previous book.  Susanna Kearsley has a writing style that brings you right into the story. Her books are lengthy, but they're so interesting that they don't feel as long as they are. This is only the second book I've read by her, but I'll definitely be reading more.  Like, The Winter Sea, The Firebird tells two stories - one set in the present day and one set in the past. While I especially liked the character of Robbie in the present day story, I found Anna's story from the past much more interesting and intriguing. When the author took the story out of the past and back into the present day story, I did find myself a little irritated, probably because I wasn't nearly as engaged in that story. Another thing I found myself doing while reading the present day story passages, was skipping over a lot of the description of St. Petersburg, mainly because I wanted to get back to Anna's story. For those reasons, this book gets 4 stars instead of 5. Overall a very enjoyable read.  PS: It's also very interesting to read the section at the end of the book where the author explains some of her research into the historical figures.

It is a thriller written from the points of view of three complicated, troubled women: Anna, Megan, and Rachel (the main character).  I picked this book to read because it has been so popular for such a long time, and I like to keep at least sorta-up on to date on these types of books, considering that I work as a library clerk. It makes it easier to chat with customers about different types of books, and make recommendations if I am well-read in more genres that just my favourite one or two. And lately, I've just been in a bit of a book rut so it was time to read a few outside of romance / erotica!  I liked the pacing of The Girl on the Train. It is an easy read that I got through in two sittings. I felt that the outcome of the novel was hidden for most of the novel, although I did suspect the killer's identity several chapters before Rachel did.  One of things that I appreciated was the author's decision to not make any particular characters the \"good guys\". Every single character from the Rachel to the police officers and the \"red-haired man in the train station\" were flawed people, everyone with something to hide, to prove, to overcome. It helped the story to stay grounded in my opinion and stopped me from assuming the character's POV as my own. I didn't particularly cheer for any one or root against the other.  Overall, I did find this book to be entertaining but I am not sure why it received as much attention as it did. I can definitely name several books along this line that I would recommend much more strongly to another reader, The House Between Tides, for one. This story was good, I just didn't find it to be particularly memorable.",eng,0,Sun Jul 02 14:30:49 -0700 2017,347

There aren't enough fetishes in the world, so you have to write about the Loch Ness Monster? Really? Way weird me out before my upcoming trip to Scotland in a month.  Not only did the writing style make me cringe (phrases like \"glistening garden\" and \"sopping pussy\" and \"raging manhood\"), but it fell flat once it was just orgasm after orgasm. Kayleigh was a bit of a perverted sort of girl from the start, thinking about her friends quite sexually from the get-go. Throw in a mythical beast with two penises and the magical ability to transport them to a tropical \"cove\" in the middle of the Loch Ness (complete with berries and sunshine), and you have a very \"horny\" teenage girl grinding herself all over everything and everyone. Heck, she even tries to give a very irresponsible boat captain, Fergus, a handjob in the middle of a horrible storm. He has better things to do, like making sure you all don't die because you begged him to take you out to see Nessie in the middle of a storm. There was a reason your trip to the Loch Ness was cancelled, love.  I was hoping for the ending to throw a \"it was all a weird dream\" curveball at me, but no. It was just as messed up as we read. No weird sexual dreams here. It all happened, apparently. And it \"changed\" her forever. Yeah, I'd change too if I had a hundred feet of mythical beast penis impaling me. Scary stuff.  It's not all bad though - actually, wait, it was. It was just as terrible as I expected when I saw this floating around on Tumblr. Orgasm after orgasm. All the girls did was either masturbate, have oral sex, or have sex with Nessie and the boat captain. That was it. That's the story. Well done.  Also they returned (after three??? days on the \"island\") with no repercussions. I guess this is 'erotica' after all, a genre that truly knows no bounds. This little tale certainly confirms that there is no place in my library for mythical beast double-penis sex.",eng,4,Tue Mar 18 05:01:05 -0700 2014,364

Set in Sokal, Poland during the German Invasion and all the Jews are being rounded up and put into the ghetto or being killed outright and anyone who helps the Jews is summarily executed for their efforts. That's what makes Franciszka and her daughter, Helena true heroes these women put their lives on the line for people they barely knew, they gave them a place to hide, food and gave them their lives because none of these people would have survived the Nazi's, well Vilheim may have survived but his soul would have become so scared by what he was forced to do that he would have never been the same.  These two amazing women not only hid 3 Jewish families but also a German Soldier who could not do what his commanding officer was asking of him he had an acquaintance with Franciszka, who reminded him of his Oma and of course she hid him , she hid them all and none knew about the others.  This woman's courage just floored me especially when she invited the German Commandant to dinner with 2 Jewish families in the basement and another in the shed but it made her above suspicion and when the Germans moved tanks into her yard and were a little close for comfort she talks them into moving everything out of her yard when asked how she did it she says, \"Always point out what is in the best interest of the other person if you want them to do something. Works on everyone.\"  There are some great quotes in this book these are my favorites:  \"Helena, there are three kinds of people in the world. One that would have seen the suffering cat and not have given it a second thought. Another that would have seen the same cat and said to themselves, 'Oh, isn't that a pity' before continuing about their business. Finally, there is the kind that sees the suffering, feels the empathy, and then goes one step further by taking action to help. That is you. You didn't leave the cat there to perish. I am proud that you are my daughter. Think what a wonderful place the world would be if everyone was like that.\"  \"I always thought courageous people were those who were not afraid. Meeting Franciszka and her daughter, I realize that courageous people are afraid like everyone else. They just act despite the fear.\"  \" If you choose to do the right thing, it's a conscious decision at first. Then it becomes second nature. You don't have to think about what is right because doing the right thing becomes who you are, like a reflex. Your actions with time become your character.\"  This was a great book and I would highly recommend this story, it's a short book that packs a powerful punch.  4 Stars",eng,1,Sat Jul 27 09:51:45 -0700 2013,489

Much like \"Otranto\", this is just a bizarre, mostly silly storytelling exercise that does not offer a lot to the modern horror fiction reader. As I read it, I felt it was an attempt at satirizing a tale out of 1001 Arabian Nights.  I usually don't like discussing plots, but I think I will here because I feel I need to expand on my last point. The story starts with a wealthy Caliph who desires extreme power and arcane knowledge. He meets a black Indian who promises him all of this. The Indian rarely speaks and there is an episode where he becomes a magical fat ball that plays havoc with the whole city in which the Caliph lives as all the palace officials try and catch it and kick it. His mother, unbeknownst to him, has a great interest in the arcane and burns mummies and bodies and etc. with the help of one-eyed black negresses that attend on her every whim in her magical tower inside the palace. The Indian is in fact an evil genie that lures the Caliph onto a journey to his lair through a mountain in which bizarre animals eat and murder a large part of the Caliph's staff and soldiers as they travel to the genie's lair. There is an odd love triangle along the way involving the Caliph. In the end, when he reaches the lair of the genie, he is damned to the most painful torments based on his mother's desire for power and his own greed.  In other words -- a Gothic take on an Arabian Nights fable. An odd mix to my mind.  One is struck by the author's prodigious imagination in writing this tale, but I ultimately wondered why he felt the need to write this so haphazardly -- I couldn't tell if he wanted the reader to take it as a joke or if he was serious in his moral at the end.  Read the introduction for sure -- the author's life was just as odd as this tale was.",eng,0,Mon Aug 25 02:12:01 -0700 2014,357
858529facf78f148d1f99d0c64883a28,7747064,"The Iron Daughter (The Iron Fey, #2)",2995873,Julie Kagawa,f828deeedd22fdaf4062d1cda5d2a326,4,"Actual Rating: 3.8/5  You can find this review, together with other reviews of books I've read in my blog: http://floatinginathousandworlds.blog...  MY REVIEW:  When i first read the Iron King (The Iron Fey #1) I was mainly dissapointed by the narrative style and Meghan's dumbness. Then The Iron Daughter fell into my hands, and i wasn't expecting at all that I would fall for a book of this series. See, the narrative style got better so I only had to cope with Meghan's infinite stupidity, whining and love problems but there was a payback: Lots of action, lots of abrupt changes, lots of slaps-in-the-face that made Meghan change to someone better!  The Iron Fey has a Part 1 and Part 2. If you want to avoid getting spoiled at all, you can skip the following to the part where I review the characters.  Part 1 is Meghan's stay and captivity in Tir Na Nog where lots of interesting things happen. That's the point where she faces Queen Mab's endless cruelty and she is all alone as Ash claims that he tricked her and was not in love with her all along. Tir Na Nog is so artfully created, I was instantly enamored and filled with fear - the ice-glazed palace, the Goblin Market, the humans encased in ice that decorate the palace, the looming darkness. At some point things change, the truth is uncovered and Ashe helps Meghan escape, where they meet the fact that there is a traitor in the winter court. They find shelter in an old fort, a place where Ash and Ariella (Ash's betrothed and long dead beloved one) used to stay between their hunts. That's where Robin Goodfellow/Puck joins them and Ash decides to leave, as he has to end things between him and Meghan once and for all. Part 1 ends in a heartbreakingly beautiful scene, where in a sea of glowing magical flowers that create Ariella's dancing and happy image, it becomes clear to Meghan that Ash loved the dead girl all along. Then Ash leaves.  Part 2 is where the action begins. Puck, Meghan, Grimalkin the cat and an unexpected ally find refuge in the Exiles Queen Leanansidhe's apartments where they plan how to overthrow the new Iron King.  THE CHARACTERS:  1) Meghan Chase: Well, if you've read the rest of the review, you will probably have realized that i don't have the best opinion about her. What infuriates me most is that we spend most of the book with a Meghan like this:  Why? Because of Ash, who for all she knows, tricked her, left her, and is still in love with a dead girl. For Fuck's Sake Meghan!  2) Ash:  \"He shook his head, once. \"I wasn't fair to you,\" he murmured. \"I knew the  laws, better than anyone. I knew it would end...like this. I ignored my better judgment, and for  that, I'm sorry.\" His voice didn't change. It was still calm and polite, but I felt an icy hand  squeeze my heart as he continued. \"But, after tonight, we'll be enemies. Your father and my  queen will be at war. If I see you again, I might kill you.\" His eyes narrowed, and his voice  turned cold. \"For real this time, Meghan.\"  He half turned, as if to leave. The glow of the flowers made a halo of light  around him, only accenting his unearthly beauty. In the distance, Ariella danced and twirled,  free from sorrow and pain and the trials of the living. \"Go home, Princess,\" murmured the  Unseelie prince. \"Go home, and forget. You don't belong here.\"\"  I really don't want to spoil you, but I prefer this Ash much better that the one he becomes in the end of the series. He let me down a bit when he lied about his feelings, but the Ash of The Iron Daughter is honorable, cold and he knows where his loyalties belong. Generally I am not a big fan of male heroes who go over the board for their beloved one. I like it when everyone stands their ground.  In order to properly spoil you then, Ash's growing feelings win over his loyalty and in the end he betrays everything in order to be with Meghan. I did like the fact that he was honest with himself and his feelings, I didn't like the immaturity of such a decision.  3) Puck:  \"\"You're kind of blind, you know?\" Puck whispered, smiling to soften his  words. \"I wouldn't defy Oberon for just anyone. But, for you...\" He leaned forward, touching  his forehead to mine. \"I'd come back from the dead for you.\"\"  Well, well, well. During reading The Iron King, I was wondering when the big revelation would happen. I can't say that Puck did right, waiting for such a long time to show his feelings, but then again... Meghan? What about safety of choices, instead of endless recklessness and erratic decisions? I don't think that Meghan gives him a proper chance, because as I already pointed out:  And of course, when Meghan chooses Ash, that's what happens:  Sorry Puck. For Meghan, your option never existed.  3) Grimalkin: The cat who saves the day. Looking back, without him Puck and Meghan would still be lost somewhere in the Wildwood. Grimalkin is the cold voice of logic, the one who always makes me laugh even when the others are facing the nastiest situation. The explanation he gives for all these?  \" I'm a Cat. \"  4) Leanansidhe: The queen of the Exiles is beautiful, creepy and cruel beyond measure. I found her interesting, as she is close to the kind of the female book characters I like.  5) IRONHORSE: Well he is quite the surprise. Without him, that story wouldn't be the same either as he protected Meghan until the end. I really hated the way Leanansidhe treated him, end the fact that he died in the end.",eng,1,Sat Aug 02 14:20:22 -0700 2014,987

I understood the message about how precious life is and how valuable our time here should be spent and never wasted. I just wasn't impressed about the way in which the story was told. If he wanted to create Father Time and people that needed realizing their value, I would have preferred deeper subject matter and more richly created characters.  Both Sarah and Victor I found were annoying and hard to connect with for me. I found Sarah, a teen girl who is so desperate for attentions from a boy that she completely ignores all the signs from him that he's not really interested. The boy she was interested in was a complete cliche by the way. As for victor? Well rarely are there people with that much money and power to be likable in the first place. He reminded me of Mr. burns from the Simpsons. I think they even had an episode about the very thing victor was doing to himself.  I waited for that big A-ha moment but was sadly disappointed when it didn't happen. All that said, I loved the narrator of this audio, he was wonderful. Together with Mitch alboms beautiful words and his rich narration is mostly where the strs came from, not the story alone.",eng,0,Wed Oct 31 09:18:09 -0700 2012,231

I guess I assumed it was going for farcical erotic sex romp with that cover and title, but then you read it, and IT'S NOT THAT AT ALL! It's actually got substance and characters you dig into and emotional depth that pulls you in.  The authors offered some ARC copies and I was lucky enough to get one, and when I got into the story, I realized that all of my assumptions based on the cover were off. Yes, there's comedy in it, but that's more from the interplay of the characters--Tony's family, i.e. in the way that your group of friends become your family, and in this case, all of Tony's friends are from his time in the porn industry! And then there's Emmy, the woman Tony meets who's not a part of his world at all, and when the sparks start to fly there, you just can't stop reading. They were so REAL together, it was refreshing. Literally, I couldn't put this book down, I read it in a day, it was so good.  Because yes, while this novel is about a retired porn star (book starts with his retirement party - he's all of 38 years old), it's also asking larger questions that all of us have faced at one time or another about how to handle it when one phase of our lives end and another begins. It's wicked scary! Though granted, not all of us are driving around rented Lamborghini's  Anyway, there's a lot more sweetness in this tale than you might expect from a book about a has-been porn star, and I can't leave off this review without giving out a loud holla to all the small-junked men out there!
