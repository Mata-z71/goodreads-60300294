 I loved the plot to this book. Nora and Patch aren't hanging out as much anymore, mostly because of unfortunate events and a little of Nora's doing. Yet, she still wants to see him all the time. In this book we find out more about how the Archangels and the Nephilim are created or made or how they interact and stuff like that. We meet more people and a lot of dirty secrets are brought out. 
 We see a lot more of Marcie in this one. Can't say I like Marcie but this book may make you think differently about her. Oh and she seems to be spending a lot of time with Patch. We also meet more characters. I have to say a character I thought was bad was actually not important at all and one I thought was good was definitely not. I really have to say that one of the bad guys I wasn't expecting at all. AT ALL. I even liked him :/ 
 I couldn't believe the ending though!! She's so mean for ending it there. I'm really anticipating the next book! I would definitely recommend :)","",0,Thu Apr 14 20:40:06 -0700 2011,this book was even better than the first one for me i read it in less than two days and loved every minute of it i loved the plot

I put it down for weeks and only picked it back up cause I was bloody minded. I remember reading other of his books, probably Childhood's End, 2001 and Rendezvous with Rama and enjoying them when I was a teen. But I found the book had most of the sins of early sf - a cypher for a main character, completely cut off from anything that would ground the book in some sort of believable world. Interesting ideas, but it just could not hold me, even for such a short book. Such a very long short book! 
 Okay, so this is me talking completely out of my ass, but I do wonder if Clarke being gay at a time when it was not okay to be gay, is a part of what makes this book so terrible for me? I'm really glad I went back to the book, because one of the later sections is from the point of view of Alvin's best friend in the novel - Hilvar - the other half of the human beings who are telepathic and much more in touch with their feelings and the world around them. If the book had been from Hilvar's point of view I probably could have gotten into the story, but it might have been much more dangerous for Clarke, because, at least from the vantage point of today, I think Hilvar is in love with Alvin. (This might be me reading modern sensibilities into a story re-written in the 50s, yet Alvin is simply not interested in the female 'love interest' in the book and does want to hang around with his friend - 50s code for gayness?) Perhaps this is Clarke being brilliant - he's written a novel about human beings cut off from their human quality with a main character who can't admit his own desires - yet I found the book so dry and alienating that I nearly didn't make my way through it. 
 I think it is a flawed book, in the sense that, like many other reviewers, I think that once Alvin gets outside the city the book flags seriously and only picks up again right at the very end where there is a burst of - not action - but explanation! That such a small book can have such a flabby middle is quite the accomplishment! Still, it's a interesting book, both for the author's huge ego and conflicted sexuality, as well as some of its ideas. Alvin's learned humility was quite amusing! One of Clarke's constant motifs is about what comes beyond 'mankind', yet in this novel, hand waving about transcendence seems like yet another psychological escape for discomfort over the body and what it really wants. This is probably a reductionist reading, but take it for what it is, my frustrated reaction to a vexing book.",eng,3,Thu Jul 05 22:58:26 -0700 2012,am i a sf philistine clarke s book bogged right the

 What. The. Hell. 
 That was pretty much what I kept saying to myself as I read this book. It was definitely unlike anything else I have ever read. So...there's that. But considering i have spent the majority of the last 24 hours reading this book and the sequel/companion/continuation-of-the-fuckery, Pull, I am not exactly sure if i truly enjoyed the story....or was just so wrapped up in how insane it was that I had to see how it all played out. 
 Annnnnyway,... 
 Book Blurb: 
 I feel like I am wrapped in a cyclone. Everything is whirling around me, drawing the air out of my lungs and filling me with the best kind of turmoil. Every time his tongue slides against mine, a prickle in my gut tells me how right we are together. How much I need David. How much I need us. 
 I hope the cyclone never stops. 
 Emma Searfoss has spent a lifetime trying to escape her abusive stepfather. It's why she moved far away from home. It's why she's kept no ties with her remaining family. And it's why she's got a major rage problem. When her neighbor shows up to fix the kitchen in her new apartment, his enigmatic charm calms the fire in her. David is cool and collected, and he makes Emma feel safe for the first time ever. But David has his own chilling past--his six previous girlfriends have all disappeared without a trace. Emma's walking a dangerous line, but David's pull is intoxicating. And impossible to resist... 
 This is one of those books it is best to go into completely blind. The description doesn't really give anything away, which is a good thing. Because trust me, if you fall into this story the way that i did, you will constantly be questioning what the hell is going on, as well as the sanity of the main characters. 
 The book gets off to a crazy start from page one. I seriously challenge anyone to read the duel POV prologues and not have to find out how this story ends. So, I was obviously hooked immediately. And in the beginning, i actually thought that Emma was more messed up than David. Her mood swings can give anyone whiplash. And then i got more into the story....and further into David's flashbacks....and i realized that these two were in a fucked up league of their own. 
 \"I want you to jump for me. Jump off this bridge and let me save you. Then i will believe that you love me, and i will love you back.\" 
 There several times when i wanted to just give up on this book. It was making my head spin, and confused me and made me want to yell at my Kindle. But in the end...i just had to know. I had to know what the hell was going on. I had to know the motivations behind the things David did. And just when I thought I was going to get some answers, the book ends. On a GINORMOUS cliffhanger! Like, there could be no bigger cliffhanger than the way this book ends. And once again, i was angry and frustrated and wanted to throw kittens. 
 And then it hit me. 
 This author is a flipping genius. Because her little messed up story completely took over my life while i was reading it. And while it was driving me nuts and I wasn't overly fond of the main characters....i still cared enough to keep reading.

Perkins,5514ab568e37f5e99c7cdb7b2f9185a3,5,"Singing Her Alive is the first novel Diana K. Perkins has published. As I write this review, her book has already won seven awards, most of them for LGBTQ fiction. Perkins well deserves all of them. 
 This is a three-generation story filled with the richly detailed lives of people I'd like to know. Sarah, who is in her early thirties and single and has a good job in Boston, returns to her home village in the Willimantic River valley in Connecticut for the funeral of her grandmother, Rebecca. This part of the story is set in the Sixties. 
 Sarah helps her mother, Beatrice, clean out the house Rebecca, Beatrice's father Peter, and a \"housekeeper\" known as \"Aunt Doris\" lived in. She finds journals Doris and Rebecca kept from the time they met in 1898 in Willimantic, then a thriving mill town. They were roommates in a strictly ruled house for young women working in a mill. Young farm or small-town women such as Doris and Rebecca sought a mill job because it paid them much more than they could earn for any other work they might do--and gave some of them a desirable independence from men. 
 As she reads the journals, Sarah comes upon one surprise after the other in the story of her grandparents, Doris, and Peter's friend William, who owned a nearby farm--and their descendants, Beatrice, Sarah, William's son Michael, and Michael's son Harry. 
 This is also the story of the attempt of the four older people to combat the intolerance of their time with a bold and breathtaking subterfuge. 
 Even as that story proceeds, Sarah begins a close friendship with Alice, the attractive mechanic who comes out to fix the flat tire Sarah endures at the end of her trip home for her grandmother's funeral. Having decided to buy from her mother the house Doris, Rebecca, and Peter lived in, Sarah ultimately realizes she has to choose between Alice and Harry. 
 I couldn't wait to find out what happened next in this novel. And yet the gravity of it appealed to me even more. Many of our ancestors must've led versions of the lives Doris, Rebecca, Peter, and William chose to lead in 1898. Some of them--most of them, I'd hope--might've gotten away with it.

Told in two perspectives and going back to back every other chapter, this crime story keeps you awake. The Whites are \"those [people] who had committed criminal obscenities on their [watch] and then walked away untouched by justice.\" (pg 26) This group of experienced detectives, with Billy Graves as the main character, had a few \"Whites\" altogether from their time in law enforcement. Their stories mesh and it's a mystery that unfolds without it being obvious. 
 The dialogue hides what would make for a boring book well and makes it an entertaining book. Not much underlining or notes in the margin for this one (maybe it's because having a pen at the beach is weird). The dialogue between characters flows so well that there is no need to use poetic language (what I tend to underline) to describe the story. There is some of that, but one of the things I enjoyed the most was the book's dialogue. It's just one great story!",eng,0,Fri Jun 05 14:35:17 -0700 2015,this was my beach read this past week loved it told in two perspectives and going back to back every other chapter this crime story

Although it's short (160 pages), you won't want to try to read it on the beach, but it won't break your brain, either. It's not so much reportage as is it truth-seeking. Don't come in expecting James Patterson and you won't be disappointed.

It kind of reminded me of a Lori Foster book. Strong, hunky, big male character with a heart of gold and a protective streak. Connor Danson is the name of this guy and he's in a witness protection program. After witnessing a murder his hardware store is burnt to the ground & he received death threats so they've relocated him to a small town (against his wishes) and his sister and his 5 year old twin nephews have been sent off in another direction. He's hating being in hiding & living a lie but whilst he's there he meets Leslie and he's really attracted to her. Despite a not do great start tge feeling is mutual & they are starting a relationship together when Connor has to go & testify. I wasnt rapt with the ending but cant help thinking this book may have a sequel snd if so I reckon I'll be reading it. LOL...Oh wow....I've just done a quick search in Goodreads and it's not that there's a sequel. Actually this is listed as Virgin River #17. It seems I already own Virgin River #5 (Second Chance Pass). I wonder how many in the series and how I'll find them all!","",1,Tue Dec 08 03:30:38 -0800 2015,this was my first robyn carr novel and i liked it it kind of reminded me of a lori foster book strong

Cherry,ced428af18e4e36ceed69962e37804b9,5,"This series of books was one I discovered completely by accident, as it always seems my favorites have been. Each of these books has touched my heart, but each for a completely different reason. 
 I hesitate in adding too much in this review, only because I don't want to delve too much into any part, as giving away too much would take away from the development that MAKES the story. This story was full of complexities, not only in characters, but in plot and twists of the story line. What made this book great for me was the believe-ability of the character's experiences. Imperfect characters, with imperfections I can relate to, always pull me into the story. In this case, I felt so much for these characters. By the first chapter my heart was tied to each of them 
 I feel as though there are so many issues in this story which readers would relate to, even the ones they might not want to talk about. So often we hide within ourselves and never allow our full potential to come to the surface. The characters experienced this, in varying degrees. Each of them had something they weren't willing to face that held them back, and by allowing themselves to live in the past, they damaged their future. 
 This is absolutely a must read. And if you haven't read the others in the series, YOU MUST! They're each a standalone, but the deep feeling carries over through each of the stories. Each book will touch your heart in a different way.","",0,Thu Apr 21 17:47:32 -0700 2016,this series of books was one i discovered completely by accident as it always seems my favorites have been each

 Afficher l'image d'origineEllen Urbani 
 << Landfall >> nous fait le portrait croise de deux jeunes filles de dix-huit ans qui, malgre leur difference de couleur (Rose est blanche, Rosy est noire - la premiere vient de la classe moyenne, la seconde d'un milieu tres populaire) ont beaucoup de points communs. Toutes deux sont brillantes, et ont ete elevees par des femmes qui les ont eues jeunes et ont du se debrouiller seules pour elever leur enfant : le pere de Rose a quitte sa mere quand celle-ci etait enceinte, celui de Rosy s'est suicide avant que celle-ci ne naisse. On decouvre sous la plume d'Ellen Urbani ces deux relations mere-fille, si proches mais pourtant si differentes. Gertrude, la mere de Rose, est une mere aimante mais qui a eleve sa fille avec durete, pour que celle-ci soit autonome et respectueuse. Rosy, quant a elle, est tres proche de sa mere, une femme gaie et affectueuse. Malheureusement Cilla est bipolaire, et Rosy doit constamment veiller sur sa mere, parfois sous l'emprise de crises tres violentes. 
 ; 
 On suit dans << Landfall >> l'enquete de Rose qui a eu acces au dossier de la jeune morte grace a un policier compatissant, et grace a quelques indices (une page d'annuaire, une carte de visite, un billet de bus) retrace l'itineraire de Rosy pour comprendre qui elle etait et pourquoi elle avait parcouru tant de kilometres au peril de sa vie pour arriver jusqu'a Tuscaloosa - Rose est obsedee par le fait de retrouver la famille de Rosy pour expliquer a ses proches comment elle est morte et leur faire beneficier de sa police d'assurance. En parallele, Ellen Urbani, a travers le portrait de Rosy, nous raconte la catastrophe de Katrina, avec l'eau qui monte dans la maison ou sont refugiees Cilla et Rosy, avec la peur, les dilemmes, la survie coute que coute - a n'importe quel prix. Puis c'est le superdome ou sont parques les survivants, dans des conditions d'hygiene deplorables, sans eau ni nourriture, avec des medecins et des volontaires depasses par les evenements - des descriptions qui ne sont pas sans rappeler celles du Vel d'Hiv. 
 ; 
 La plume d'Ellen Urbani est tres habile, les deux jeunes femmes sont extremement bien incarnees, et je me suis beaucoup attachee a ces deux filles battantes, pretes a tout, l'une pour proteger sa mere, l'autre pour decouvrir la verite sur celle qu'elle a contribue a tuer. Les relations mere-fille, a la fois aimante et triste sont egalement tres bien decrites, tout comme toute la galerie de personnages que les deux jeunes femmes vont rencontrer, a quelques semaines d'intervalle. Et que dire des descriptions de la catastrophe et de ses ravages, poignantes, violentes, rageantes sans jamais etre pleurnichardes. Tout le roman sonne tres juste, sans manicheisme, mais avec beaucoup de profondeur. J'ai quand meme regrette le twist employe par l'auteur. Sans pouvoir bien sur le developper ici, non seulement je l'ai vu arriver a des kilometres, mais je pense qu'il etait tout aussi dispensable qu'il etait un peu trop gros a mes yeux et surtout que le livre n'avait pas besoin de ca pour etre reussi.

 Don't judge a book by it's cover? Well, The Violets of March has one of the most magnificent covers I have ever laid eyes on. It's simple, the dash of purple amidst the muted tones is stunning and the weathered and layered feel is fitting for the novel. I had high hopes when I cracked the cover based on the gorgeousness of it and I wasn't disappointed. 
 Firstly, still on the cover, I will try not to complain about my copy being defaced in an accident involving a cottage and vodka. In my defence...the book was so lovely that it remained on the coffee table to sneak peaks at during spare moments! The Violets of March is a delightful, effortless read with an astounding setting that made me want to pick up and move somewhere with a beach immediately. The intrigue surrounding the 1940's journal was as easy to be drawn into as Emily's present day story and I had no difficulty moving back and forth between the two. 
 As someone who has taken the last year to do exactly what Emily has done, I appreciated this story. I loved that, although you could tell she was hurting, she didn't come across as whiny or feeling too sorry for herself and Emily's desire to reconnect with herself resonated deeply with me. Every character was portrayed perfectly and I especially grew attached to Aunt Bee's character. Her strength and spunk reminded me of one of my own Grandmothers at times and I knew from several conversations with her before she passed, and some overheard ones as a young child that I now understand, that everyone has a past and stories that not everyone is privy to. This personal knowledge drew me even deeper into the novel and I couldn't wait to discover what would transpire with Emily and what she would unearth between the pages of the journal. 
 There were twists and turns in this novel that I wasn't expecting and some that I had figured out, although this didn't detract from my enjoyment. The mystery, romance and heartbreak involved in this novel had me in tears at times and I had difficulty setting this novel down. 
 This was an outstanding debut and I can't wait to devour more from Sarah Jio.",en-US,1,Wed Jul 18 13:09:16 -0700 2012,originally reviewed at novel escapes don t judge a book by it s cover well the

After reading the first it was kind of hard not to want to go on with series. I love the characters, who make me feel like I am a part of their life from the moment we meet. The world they live in is not perfect but has enough reality added that you feel like you know it or have at least been there before. 
 The Sullivan's are a big and boisterous family who just happen to be witches. But even more than that they are a family of coders and mathematical whizzes who have been running games over the net for years. Enchanters Realm is a popular game among humans and witches, but has a special level that only witches are usually able to reach because it requires the use of magic. Enter the Hacker, a guy who codes better than a lot of people, including some of those Sullivan's. Nell and Jaime are not happy when they realize that they have been hacked but figure that they person is a witch that they simply have not met. 
 Daniel is a first class coder and does it for a living most of the time. He does like to peek in the backdoor of games once in a while but nothing that would be considered cheating. He finds himself plying against the wizard, but notices that some of the code seems redundant or useless, not understanding that it is magic. He manages to hold off an attack of real magic with nothing but his code, pretty good. Then he decides he wants to work for them, that could be the craziest idea he ever had. 
 The writing and the story are light, fun, with a sense of romance. Anyone would enjoy this story and series.",eng,1,Mon Oct 28 20:11:32 -0700 2013,this was the second book in this series that i read after reading the first it was kind of hard not to want to go on

Each Tuesday is a small talk, an advice from someone older and wiser than you, it's not really a story telling you to do this or that. It's just a small talk, an open message that you need to think a little bit deeper to understand. Thus, it can be lighter than other big talk self-help book, yet much more profound. That's why i like it better than most other self-help books. 
 However, self-help book is still not my type. And unfortunately, i read this book when i have too much thing to do, need to be away from my beloved ones to get some achievement here. So it's just not the right time for me to read something about death and life, about family and love, and tell me to care less about material stuffs to focus about the meaning of love and fulfil the mission of life. No, it's just not the time. 
 So i give it 3 starts, should be higher than that if given by someone who appreciate the book in the right way, or if i read it in a different period of life, when i can live with a slower pace, just not right now.",eng,0,Sun Mar 12 07:27:51 -0700 2017,self help is usually not my cup of tea still tuesday with morrie is the best self help book i ve ever read each tuesday is a small talk an advice

 What a book! The action starts on page 1 and doesn't let up until the end. 
 The pace of the story was just right. The short, snappy chapters kept me turning the pages with bated breath, wondering what was going to happen next! 
 The main characters, particularly Joe, are very well depicted. They have their good points and they have bad ones, but don't we all. That's what makes them seem so human. 
 The dialogue is believable and flows easily between the characters. 
 There's never a dull moment in the plot, so if you're after a thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat this is definitely one for you.","",1,Fri May 06 08:35:12 -0700 2016,i would like to

I picked it up to try out Trisha Ashley's writing style as she seems to be very prominent in this genre and after enjoying Sophie Kinsella so much I felt like this would be something I would enjoy. 
 On the whole, this story was a little boring. The plot and what happened to the characters was pretty predictable and there weren't any surprises. I did enjoy the writing style and the way that the first person protagonist was developed. 
 Overall I will definitely be trying some more Trisha Ashley in the future but this definitely isn't something I would recommend.

48,0014df75cef2f227a2d824ec0f852107,90533,"Rapture in Death (In Death, #4)",17065,J.D. Robb,0c154d3717b690fbf8ff0446af3e2e18,3,"Originally posted at Otherwhere.Co 
 This is one of those series, that is great to pick up once in awhile and cleanse the palette of less well written reads. The adult tone with amazing characters and, as always, a fantastic speculative storyline, I have yet to be disappointed by any of the J.D. Robb's books. Plus they're quick, so they're perfect for that mini-escape, knowing it's going to offer the perfect balance. 
 This time Eve and Rourke are on the moon (literally), opening a new uber luxurious hotel. Bliss is quickly interrupted by a creepy suicide, which Eve immediately jumps into with suspicions of foul play. The usual cast of characters are back with their own special personalities that I didn't even realize I missed until they showed up on the page. 
 The chemistry between Eve and Rourke is at a boiling point and very entertaining. As a side note, well into book four I am still waiting for Eve to finally just... let... go. They're married and yet her walls have not tumbled down for him. He knows this and I am waiting for him to break and either temporary leave or throw her for the loop she needs. Hmmm, that would be a good read, especially with the make up session. 
 Regardless, I love these books and someday I may make it through the thirty plus that are in the series.",eng,0,Wed Nov 16 20:54:14 -0800 2011,originally posted at otherwhere co this is one of those

Without saying too much, as I enjoyed having minimal knowledge of the plot while reading this, the story follows a girl called Nao who undergoes some pretty horrific events, and a woman called Ruth who knows they are happening but can do nothing to stop them. It's a really fascinating narrative experiment, and there were also many heart-wrenching moments or great epiphanies. My only qualm was that somewhere in the middle I felt Nao's narrative got slightly lost, and took a few chapters to find its place again. Other than that, this really was a brilliant work, and I'm interested into reading some more Ozeki very soon.",en-GB,0,Sun Nov 09 05:40:50 -0800 2014,i wasn t entirely sure what to expect when i went

It's a good thing I'm a character person because the plot--evil company creates a super drug that enhances paranormal abilities but is deadly and the good guys who have naturally enhanced abilities have to save the day--has definitely been done before. I kept waiting for the hero's backstory from the prequel to figure in more, but I guess that story was just to explain why Shane was BLACKLISTED (which is said about a gajillion times). 
 One thing I love about Brockman's books is her writing of gay characters. She's sometimes really obvious in her pro-gay philosophy (I keep hearing \"not that there's anything wrong with that\" even though no one says it), but her characters are good guys who anyone would be happy to have as a friend or colleague. And I appreciate how Elliot & Stephen's relationship develops along with Shane and Michelle's. 
 I'm intrigued by The character Bach, and he'll be the reason I read the next book in the series.",en-US,0,Thu Jul 05 07:55:20 -0700 2012,interesting start to a new series it s a good thing i m a

 If you like stories about witches, warlocks & demons then this is definitely a story for you. Vance has been on the run from his father for most of his life. He wasn't able to have a girlfriend or do any of the normal teenage things. Vance meets Portia and sparks start to fly then fate & destiny take over. In this book we follow Vance's life from his point of view but with Portia thrown in BUT you'll have to read it to understand that ;-) 
 I received this book free for an honest review and I was not paid to do this. I enjoyed this book a great deal and would recommend it to all. The story line flowed smoothly, the characters were fresh and meshed perfectly and I found myself relating with them in many parts of the story. I would give this book a 5. I look forward to reading more books in this series and others by Lacey Weatherford.",en-US,0,Tue Nov 19 06:51:08 -0800 2013,fire ice by lacey weatherford if you like stories about witches warlocks

SG-1 is trying to figure out what happened during their gate back, learning what happened in the time that they missed and discovering allies and enemies. Which is not as easy as it sounds. You would think right away that the Wraith would be the enemy, but no. There's a much more dangerous enemy which leads SG-1 to joint forces with the Wraith. And all through the book, O'Neill's willingness to disband SG-1 haunts the group and the reader. Then when you can take no more, you come to the end of the book. For me that ending was quite the shocker. I was left just staring at the page and I imaging that was exactly how SG-1 felt. It's a direct hit to your gut.

64,001bb427c4b4a782764222b87b083cc6,1354320,The Songs of the Kings: A Novel,3101,Barry Unsworth,435291afef0d8ef5533c251f1dcef038,4,"I have just finished reading The Songs of the Kings by Booker Prize winner, Barry Unsworth. This is an eloquent and powerfully written novel that is quite thought-provoking on several levels. The novel was published in 2003, and I have to wonder if there was an external motivation behind Unsworth's writing of the novel than simply writing a good story? More on that in a moment though. First, I think it will be useful to provide a brief bit of background on a few important aspects of Greek mythology that bear on the plot of the novel. 
 Okay, so I need all of you to dredge up and recall some of the bits and pieces of Greek mythology that you've run across in the course of your life. First, the \"Judgment of Paris\", where Paris (son of Trojan king and queen, Priam and Hecuba) selects Aphrodite as \"the most beautiful\" among the three goddesses, Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. In return, Aphrodite rewards Paris (the sycophant that he is) with the ability to 'seduce' and carry off Helen of Sparta, the wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta, and the brother of Agamemnon, the king of Mycenae. Second, as part of the agreement behind Helen choosing which suitor to marry, her father Tyndareus evoked a pledge from all of her suitors that they would rally and stand behind whoever her eventual husband was if there was ever any \"future threat to the marriage\". The suitors--pretty much all of the Greek chieftains--so pledged, and Helen then selected Menelaus to be her husband. Now, fast forward about ten-years, and along comes 'pretty-boy' Paris, and Helen elopes with him and off to Troy they go. It is safe to say that this action probably qualified as a \"threat to the marriage\" of Helen and Menelaus. Consequently, the Greeks rally their forces, under the command of Agamemnon, and set off to destroy Troy and 'rescue' Helen from the 'lecherous' clutches of Paris. The Greek fleet sails to its initial rendezvous point on the east coast of Greece, to a little fishing village known as Aulis. This is where Unsworth picks up the tale in The Songs of the Kings. 
 Unsworth's book is a story in five acts, and must be a nod to the structure typically utilized by the ancient Greek dramatists. The Greek fleet is trapped at Aulis by contrary winds and weather conditions, and the army, and its chieftains, are getting restless and losing their will to carry the fight to Troy. In Unsworth's novel, we read of a cabal of the senior Greek leaders, instigated and led by Odysseus (he brings new meaning to the term \"Machiavellian\"), that begins to develop a conspiracy that will compel Agamemnon and Menelaus to irrevocably commit to the War with Troy. Using intrigue, deception, selective interpretation and misinformation, the conspirators convince Agamemnon that Zeus requires the sacrifice of his eldest daughter, Iphigeneia; and that with her sacrifice, the weather conditions will change and the Greek fleet can set sail. At first, as one can well imagine, Agamemnon is horrified at the thought of having to offer up his child as a sacrifice to the gods. Odysseus and the other conspirators determinedly continue to brow-beat and cajole Agamemnon into doing the right thing for Greece and restoring its national honor. 
 The Greek leaders, in the novel, are really more like a gang of Wall Street CEOs, all trying to exert their own influence and power and looking to acquire more treasure, honor and glory. Morality and principles mean little to nothing to most of them. Unsworth's portrayal of Agamemnon, Menelaus, Odysseus, and Achilles is unflattering at best. These are vain-glorious men who care little for anything or anybody if it doesn't benefit them in the long-run. Unsworth satirically plays off of many of the personality traits that can be gleaned from Homer's portrayal in The Iliad and The Odyssey, or of the later Greek playwrights like Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. For example, there is Agamemnon, the thuggish control-freak; Menelaus, the weak-willed cuckold; or Odysseus, the clever and manipulative talker; or Achilles, the sulking glory-hound dilettante; or the two Ajaxes, Big and Little, both just brutish homicidal maniacs. The one character that sees through the conspiracy is Calchas, the foreign-born priest of Apollo. He knows that this is all a terrible fabric of lies, but feels powerless to stand up to the conspirators. 
 In the 'second act' of the book, the conspirators have finally succeeded in convincing Agamemnon that he is really left with no choice, and that he must sacrifice his daughter for the national good. He is told that in the long-run the poets will sing his praises for the courage he showed in reaching this difficult decision. Unsworth even creates the character of a blind bard, or \"singer\", who the conspirators use to disseminate their lies and misinformation in his songs and poems that recites at the soldiers fires at night. If a story is told a certain way long enough, it becomes true. The conspirators understand the use of the media and religion in getting 'the facts' out there for the masses. Now, the entire army knows that Agamemnon must sacrifice his daughter to propitiate the gods and create the favorable conditions necessary to prosecute the war. 
 Unsworth also takes the reader back to Mycenae in the novel's 'third act' and spends several chapters introducing and developing the characters of Iphigeneia and her maid-servant, Sisipyla. After getting to know Iphigeneia, the reader can't help but become more and more horrified at the impending doom that seems to face this likeable young woman. I need to mention too that Iphigeneia is also a priestess for the goddess Artemis (the twin sister of Apollo, and goddess of the hunt, wild animals, goddess of childbirth, and the protector of all young living things, animal and human). Iphigeneia has been trained in this role by her mother, Clytemnestra, Agamemnon's wife and the Mycenaean queen. The horror just continues to mount when a delegation from Agamemnon shows up in Mycenae with the news that Iphigeneia must travel to Aulis in order to be married to Achilles. Of course, Clytemnestra and Iphigeneia think this is wonderful news, as Achilles, the son of a goddess (Thetis) is also the champion of the entire Greek army. The reader knows though that this is all just a ruse to get Iphigeneia to Aulis. I felt utterly helpless as I read about this lovely young woman happily packing her wedding trousseau and preparing for the trip to see her father and to meet her betrothed. 
 You'll have to read the 'last act' of the novel to find out how it ends. There's an intriguing twist that had me holding my breath as I read the last 50 pages of the book. Iphigeneia and her maid, Sisipyla, have arrived in Aulis, and the tension among all of the characters was palpable and thick enough to cut with a bronze sacrificial knife (pun thoroughly intended). At this point in the book, that old adage \"the train has left the station\" really applies, as things said, and things done are virtually irrevocable at this stage in the plot. This knowledge, on the part of the reader just adds to the theater and drama of Unsworth's tale. 
 As I read this brilliant little novel there were a couple of observations that jumped out at me. First, this book could have been an almost line-by-line script for the Bush Administration's run up to the war with Iraq. The twisting and manipulation of facts by Odysseus and the other Greek chieftains in the novel eerily reminded me of the \"weapons of mass destruction\" issue and all of the speeches given by the President and members of his administration as the case for war with Iraq was constructed. Secondly, I think Unsworth is also telling the story of the dangers of religious and gender persecution here. Remember that Iphigeneia is a priestess for the goddess Artemis--an archetypal 'Mother Goddess'. The Greek army's chief priests all serve Zeus, the Father of the gods, and are vocal proponents of the patriarchal system that was becoming widespread across the Bronze Age Mediterranean region. These priests needed to eradicate the last vestiges of the worship of the Mother Goddess and the female deities. By labeling Iphigeneia as a \"witch\" and then publicly killing her as a priestess of Artemis powerfully symbolized asserting their strength and control. 
 After making these observations while reading Unsworth's novel, I wondered if I was simply over-reaching and reading more into this than Unsworth intended. I immediately read Euripides' last known play, Iphigeneia at Aulis (probably written about 404-402 B.C.E.). Upon finishing it, I have to say that it is my opinion that Unsworth has done a terrific job in his novel at portraying the pathos, drama, intrigue, and humanity depicted in Euripides' powerful play. Unsworth's novel makes us a party to the conspiracy, makes us feel the overwhelming guilt of a father who knows he is doing wrong, and makes us, in a somewhat voyeuristic fashion, a witness to a victim unwittingly proceeding down the path to her Fate and Destiny. This is a story about decision-making that spirals out of control and the far-reaching consequences that affected not only the primary protagonists, but the Mycenaean empire, Troy and the Trojans, and even reaches out and touches all of us in our own time--i.e., the Iraq War. Like Sophocles' great play, Antigone, Euripides' play and Unsworth's novel are hard-hitting examples of people placed in extraordinary and desperate circumstances requiring moral courage and the adoption and adherence to principled positions. The failure to find that courage or the failure to stand up in the face of tyranny or persecution can have devastating consequences. This, ultimately, is the message of Euripides in his play, Iphigeneia at Aulis, and in Barry Unsworth's beautiful novel, The Songs of Kings.","",6,Sat Oct 22 14:30:58 -0700 2011,i have just finished

unsworth satirically plays off of many of the personality traits that can be gleaned from homer s portrayal in the iliad and the odyssey or of the later greek playwrights like aeschylus sophocles and euripides for example there is agamemnon the thuggish control freak menelaus the weak willed cuckold or odysseus the clever and manipulative talker or achilles the sulking glory hound dilettante or the two ajaxes big and little both just brutish homicidal maniacs the one character that sees through the conspiracy is calchas the foreign born priest of apollo he knows that this is all a terrible fabric of lies but feels powerless to stand up to the conspirators in the second act of the book the conspirators have finally succeeded in convincing agamemnon that he is really left with no choice and that he must sacrifice his daughter for the national good he is told that in the long run the poets will sing his praises for the courage he showed in reaching this difficult decision unsworth even creates the character of a blind bard or singer who the conspirators use to disseminate their lies and misinformation in his songs and poems that recites at the soldiers fires at night if a story is told a certain way long enough it becomes true the conspirators understand the use of the media and religion in getting the facts out there for the masses now the entire army knows that agamemnon must sacrifice his daughter to propitiate the gods and create the favorable conditions necessary to prosecute the war unsworth also takes the reader back to mycenae in the novel s third act and spends several chapters introducing and developing the characters of iphigeneia and her maid servant sisipyla after getting to know iphigeneia the reader can t help but become more and more horrified at the impending doom that seems to face this likeable young woman i need to mention too that iphigeneia is also a priestess for the goddess artemis the twin sister of apollo and goddess of the hunt wild animals goddess of childbirth and the protector of all young living things animal and human iphigeneia has been trained in this role by her mother clytemnestra agamemnon s wife and the mycenaean queen the horror just continues to mount when a delegation from agamemnon shows up in mycenae with the news that iphigeneia must travel to aulis in order to be married to achilles of course clytemnestra and iphigeneia think this is wonderful news as achilles the son of a goddess thetis is also the champion of the entire greek army the reader knows though that this is all just a ruse to get iphigeneia to aulis i felt utterly helpless as i read about this lovely young woman happily packing her wedding trousseau and preparing for the trip to see her father and to meet her betrothed you ll have to read the last act of the novel to find out how it ends there s an intriguing twist that had me holding my breath as i read the last number pages of the book iphigeneia and her maid sisipyla have arrived in aulis and the tension among all of the characters was palpable and thick enough to cut with a bronze sacrificial knife pun thoroughly intended at this point in the book that old adage the train has left the station really applies as things said and things done are virtually irrevocable at this stage in the plot this knowledge on the part of the reader just adds to the theater and drama of unsworth s tale as i read this brilliant little novel there were a couple of observations that jumped out at me first this book could have been an almost line by line script for the bush administration s run up to the war with iraq the twisting and manipulation of facts by odysseus and the other greek chieftains in the novel eerily reminded me of the weapons of mass destruction issue and all of the speeches given by the president and members of his administration as the case for war with iraq was constructed secondly i think unsworth is also telling the story of the dangers of religious and gender persecution here remember that iphigeneia is a priestess for the goddess artemis an archetypal mother goddess the greek army s chief priests all serve zeus the father of the gods and are vocal proponents of the patriarchal system that was becoming widespread across the bronze age mediterranean region these priests needed to eradicate the last vestiges of the worship of the mother goddess and the female deities by labeling iphigeneia as a witch and then publicly killing her as a priestess of artemis powerfully symbolized asserting their strength and control after making these observations while reading unsworth s novel i wondered if i was simply over reaching and reading more into this than unsworth intended i immediately read euripides last known play iphigeneia at aulis probably written about number number b c e upon finishing it i have to say that it is my opinion that unsworth has done a terrific job in his novel at portraying the pathos drama intrigue and humanity depicted in euripides powerful play unsworth s novel makes us a party to the conspiracy makes us feel the overwhelming guilt of a father who knows he is doing wrong and makes us in a somewhat voyeuristic fashion a witness to a victim unwittingly proceeding down the path to her fate and destiny this is a story about decision making that spirals out of control and the far reaching consequences that affected not only the primary protagonists but the mycenaean empire troy and the trojans and even reaches out and touches all of us in our own time i e the iraq war like sophocles great play antigone euripides play and unsworth s novel are hard hitting examples of people placed in extraordinary and desperate circumstances requiring moral courage and the adoption and adherence to principled positions the failure to find that courage or the failure to stand up in the face of tyranny or persecution can have devastating consequences this ultimately is the message of euripides in his play iphigeneia at aulis and in barry unsworth s beautiful novel the songs of

 Reminds me of \"Good year\" by Peter Mayle, but minus humor which actually was the best part. 
 OK, I got a lot interesting facts about whales. 
 Story itself looks not real by many aspects: 
 *** Spoiler alert *** 
 - She has two girls 14 month apart, which means she manage having new born baby on her hand, to keep working and to build strong relation with another man, to move into his house and to get pregnant again - all in 7 month? 
 - If her boyfriend wants to be rid of her why just not let her go with both girls? It will much more sense for his political life to start from new page than try to explain where this girl came from. I guess it just to make evil person look more evil, but why stupid? 
 *** End of Spoiler alert *** 
 On my opinion, not story works around the facts of life, but facts made up to make a story more dramatic. 
 There is similarity in \"One plus one\", which has a big improvement in plot comparing to \"Silver Bay\", but also brings in a bad language which I don't like. 
 Another similar cliche I found in both books - fatherless child born from young, troubled and, sorry, not really smart mother going to be very talented! Wow, what a surprise! I know it can be a case, but it's not a rule. Kids, who live with one parent are more sensitive and responsible -yes! but I'm not sure about the talent. 
 Still - this book is a good read!",eng,1,Wed Dec 24 12:38:42 -0800 2014,as always jojo moyes is perfect narrator and knows how to keep readers hooked reminds me of good year by peter mayle but minus

 \"That night...\" she hesitated, \"...was endless. It still hasn't ended.\" 
 One year ago while working late, Margaret Simmons witnessed a murder. Panicked by the sight, she fled Boston and found solitude & anonymity in Victory Cove, Maine. She changed her name to Megan Summers and picked up hobbies such as self defense, target practice, and superior nighttime navigation - skills she hopes will give her an advantage over anyone hunting her... 
 Curious to learn about his heritage, Jake Grogan is lured to Victory Cove by a letter written by his birth mother. At the suggestion of some of the townsfolk, Jake makes his way to Wakefield House - his grandmother's home. Instead of finding his grandmother, however, he comes face to face with a hauntingly beautiful Megan Summers and she's all too eager to force him from the porch into the unfriendly Maine storms. 
 Determined not to leave Victory Cove empty handed, Jake returns to Wakefield House and through divine intervention - or Mother Nature - he ends up stranded with the beautiful but hostile young Wakefield House resident. Extenuating circumstances thrust upon them, Megan and Jake find solace and strength in each other. Will these new discoveries protect them from the physical and emotional forces that threaten to destroy them? 
 Ms. Miller's thrilling tale was told dominantly from Jake's POV, adding to Megan's mysterious past and guarded present. Megan's narration, when voiced, was peppered with current thoughts/feelings as well as a combination of dreams and flashbacks, giving readers a glimpse into the nightmare Megan has been living. 
 The characters were developed extremely well and remained consistent throughout the novel. Megan, though terrified, was determined, brave, and self reliant. Jake was strong, caring, and resourceful (MacGyver, anyone?). Their relationship was a beautiful balance of wit, reluctant attraction, and restrained heat. 
 The writing was very well done; Ms. Miller created image provoking descriptions, humorous exchanges, and wonderfully crafted prose. 
 The passage I found most beautiful: 
 \"There is a ghost at Wakefield House.\" Her lips parted, but he continued in a husky tone, \"She's so haunting. So beautiful. Pure of heart. Something divine, yet cloaked in shadows. Rooted to this house as if chains were linked about her ankles. Her wings are spread, they pump and pump, but still she can't escape.\" His smile was sad. \"And so she sits, as a sentinel-a prisoner, and waits for someone to come and release her.\"

71,001ec6f44995b74a349b8e9bb6ef4086,20359781,"Beauty and the Mustache (Knitting in the City, #4; Winston Brothers, #0.5)",5997227,Penny Reid,d9ac79e08209e2aa1abcef1c949e52a8,5,"ETA after rereading March 10 to 11, 2016: Dear book, you're amazing 
 Just so we're clear, I totally changed my mind about everything I've written about this book. 
 Original review: 
 The first thing I thought after finishing this book was if there is a book by Penny Reid that I'm actually gonna know how to rate. I think it's the same thing again as with Truth and Beard (I totally read out of order there, but screw it). Because I had no idea how I felt about that book after reading it, I decided I was going to let it all sink in for a while and then for sure I'll know. That did not happen. So now I'm going to try to sort out my thoughts right away and let you all deal with the mess that they really are. 
 All the stares 
 Beauty and the Mustache is easy to read, but a tad too long. Only a handful of important things happened, but everything in between is just filler, I guess. And there's a lot of filler that I weirdly didn't mind. 
 Also, a lot of staring going on. So. Much. Staring. All sorts of glares. People just communicating through their eyes. And amidst all those stares, I felt like I've never really got to know any of her brothers or Drew. Now that I'm thinking about it, he's the same from the start, no development in his personality. It sounds bad, but it isn't. Not for me. Because I loved his character. He was reliable, he was supportive, protective, he was quiet, observing, smart and intense and passionate. The perfect guy (that only exist in novels). So while Drew is a formed personality, Ashley is the one who develops as a character. You can say, Beauty and the Mustache is more than anything, even a love story, the story of Ashley's growth as a person, of her way back home and the discovery of her real self. 
 Penny Reid >>>>> Kristen Ashley 
 Speaking of writing, Reid's writing reminds me a lot of KA's style in its descriptiveness and repetitiveness to the point of being distracting. But luckily Reid's heroes (and heroines) did not make me see red with rage and go on a one-girl-rampage through my house at their behavior. Although I'm still annoyed with Duane (Truth and Beard) and Martin is still an ass (Attraction). 
 In every romance novel I've read so far that had some poetry lover and writer for a character, or characters that were musicians and songwriters, never ever ever, I mean ever, was I moved by their verses. Mostly I found them funny. Not good funny, either. But Drew's poems... damn. Those brought tears to my eyes. For real. Real fucking salt water dripping from my eyes. I don't pretend I know much about poetry except from what I've learned in school, which was a while now to be honest, and even then there were only few poets whose verses spoke to me. And now Penny Reid is one of them. 
 \"Fire burns blue and hot. 
 Its fair light blinds me not. 
 Smell of smoke is satisfying, tastes nourishing to my tongue. 
 I think fire ageless, never old, and yet no longer young. 
 Morning coals are cool; daylight leaves me blind. 
 I love the fire most because of what it leaves behind.\" 
 [...] 
 But before I could stop my mouth, I blurted a question at his retreating back. \"What does the fire leave behind? Destruction? Death?\" 
 Drew didn't respond until he was almost out of sight. Then he turned and, walking backward for a few steps, he called out, \"Ash--the fire leaves ash.\" 
 The heroine's name is Ash, short for Ashley. Proceed to swoon. 
 The Mustache 
 I really thought it was weird how they discussed Nietzsche and poetry of all things, in casual conversations, like some hipster couple scoffing at the rest of the world. But I realized it was their thing, something that's unique to just them. I still thought their conversations were odd, at some point pretentious, maybe even unrealistic, but that's maybe because I have never discussed philosophers with my significant other or ever heard anyone else doing so, for that matter. 
 In the end 
 Starting this rambling review, I truly was clueless what to rate Beauty and the Mustache, but the good thing is, I've decided to give this book five stars because of that poem (hidden behind the spoiler tags; I don't think it's really a spoiler, but to feel its full effect, it's just better to read it in the book, as part of the story). In my eyes, that poem alone deserves a gazillion stars. I take my hat off to Penny Reid. I can totally see why so many readers love her works.",eng,12,Sat Aug 15 00:26:23 -0700 2015,eta after rereading march number to number number dear book you re amazing just so we re clear i totally

Heilbroner,dc7d5e0263dee67892d4aff62514034d,5,"This book is about the short history of economic thought in the western world. A mildly interesting discussion of the progression from the very simple yet profound understanding of accumulation, the effects of population, labor as a resource, to utopias, laissez-faire, socialism, Marxism and communism, unbridled capitalism, imperialism, to the mysterious and dynamic modern business cycle, and the effects of socialist ideas or government intervention. The progression of thought is not as interesting as the characters, the goofy and eccentric economists like the Norwegian sociologist-economist Veblen who forged the ideas. 
 Not as dry or difficult reading as you might expect. I laughed out loud a couple times. Really. But this book just skims the surface on most topics - it serves well as an introduction. If you want to learn about economics itself, or seek a more in-depth discussion of the ideas these philosophers put forth, there are undoubtedly better sources.",eng,0,Sun Jul 22 10:12:59 -0700

 Unhinged is the fifth title in the Iron Bulls MC series and features Kadence and Blaine. 
 This book is different to Phoenyx's previous titles in this series, but I really liked it. The story line grabbed my attention from the very first page, and I couldn't put it down. 
 I really enjoyed the fact that the reader gets a glimpse into not only the Iron Bulls MC, with characters who are old favorites, and but also the Savage Dragons MC where we are introduced to a whole cast of new characters. I'm really hoping that some of these get their stories told in the future as well. 
 I thoroughly enjoyed Kadence and Blaine's story which had an abundance of twists and turns, a few questions were answered but more is yet to be revealed. 
 A great blend of romance, heat, suspense, intrigue, passion and drama. 
 I look forward to more of Phoenyx Slaughter's work and the next title in the Iron Bulls MC.

 Matt and Emily were both intriguing characters with a lot of depth. I couldn't help, but love both of them. They are not used to human emotions and their struggle with them is the same as many of the same problems that teens and children often face while growing up. 
 There is so much emotion in this story and it really just sucks you into this incredible adventure full of hope, love, and faith. 
 The twists and turns had me on the edge of my seat in anticipation and put me through a rollercoaster of emotions. I highly recommend this beautiful story to anyone who loves a good coming of age story filled with romance, adventure, and paranormal elements.",eng,0,Thu Feb 23 15:08:48 -0800 2012,until next time is

80,0022c6aaace3de97f4b3e3b6060b8f07,8487363,"My Soul to Steal (Soul Screamers, #4)",415967,Rachel Vincent,dd7f322d99918f7c58d351919eb70387,5,"My Thoughts: What can I possibly say that I haven't already said about this series? I started whizzing right through these books. I am addicted and I can't wait to read If I Die! I am so freaking excited for it. 
 Here we go again with Kaylee and her crew. In this book, Nash's ex girlfriend Sabine comes to town to win back his heart. They used to date a few years ago, before he moved away. They were each other's firsts for everything. The catch: she isn't human. Yes, thats right, another paranormal creature lurking about. Like Kaylee doesn't have it rough enough with an ex girlfriend coming back, but she's got to be a mara right? A nightmare literally. She can enter peoples dreams and radiate energy from them. She can make them experience their worst nightmare? Sounds fun, right? 
 Kaylee is still trying to forgive Nash for what happened in the previous book and she's having trouble trusting him again. She loves him but she can't forgive him just yet. 
 Mysterious deaths of teachers start hapening, in their sleep so Kaylee suspects the worst and thinks Sabine is to blame. 
 We see more of Alec in this novel. That boy (or man, since hes techinally old) is really starting to grow on me. I can kind of tell he might have feelings for Kaylee, but no acting on them of course. 
 Emma and Sophie are also present throughout the novel with their funny and snarky moments. 
 And of course Tod is around. Tod. Oh so sweet and sexy Tod. Never thought I'd be getting the hots for a grim ripper! I can start to see by Tod's reactions he may have deeper feelings for Kaylee than anyone knows. He has a habit of protecting her, and she sees his eyes swirl every once in a while, is that a good sign? Part of me, a big part, hopes that something ends up happening between Kaylee and Nash. I think by this point I am more Team Tod than Team Nash. 
 My Soul To Steal was another AWESOME installment in the soul screamers series. I'm anxious for the next book! 
 Overall: I love this series so much. With each and every book they keep getting better and more interesting. Never a dull moment. Packed with action, romance, arguing, tension, its everything I could want in a paranormal series! 
 Cover: Love Love Love. This is my favorite cover so far. I love how he is holding her. So is that Nash than? This cover is freaking adorable. 
 What I'd Give It: 5/5 Cupcakes

It's a topic that is often glossed over. Abuse itself is often glossed over but I feel emotional abuse is even more glossed over when talking about abuse. 
 This was a good story about overcoming the past and having hope for the future. I enjoyed the characters but would have liked some more backstory on both. Something to bring me in even more. I found myself sometimes wanting to be brought more into the story. 
 But as I was in an emotionally abusive relationship myself, I found this story very easy to relate to. At times reading Lauren's story was like reading my own. I think overall this is a good book and story. One that many should read if for nothing more than to relate to it or have their eyes open to abuse/emotional abuse. 4 quills!!","",0,Wed May 10 20:40:11 -0700 2017,i ve known about this book for a

 SON SAYS: 
 I really liked all of the pictures because they are funny. My favorite picture is the one where Rowdy goes in the bedroom to steal his parents' energy. It's funny because they are like little energy bottles and you get energy from them. In the main picture of the grown-ups playing, Mr. and Mrs. Weary are not one of the grown-ups and they should have been. My favorite part of the book is when the kid got his energy back at the end of the book. It was a fun part of the book when the grown-ups had lots of energy though. I really really liked this book because it's really funny. I think all people would like this book - especially tired parents. 
 MOM SAYS: 
 Well this \"in-between\" tired parent loved the concept behind this book, the over-the-top silliness of the story and illustrations, and the message underlying the story of loving and appreciating those energetic children regardless of how exhausted we are feeling. I think seriously that any parent who has children still interested in reading picture books will enjoy this book. Oh, and I'm sure kids aged 3+ will find it equally silly.

 Reviewed for Divine Magazine 
 Wow! What a rollercoaster ride that was! 
 Right from the start, I fell in love with Riley; he was fun, funny and charming in little small ways that made him so relateable, but also really different to other characters. The way he reacted to the supernatural instances that happened in his normal, everyday contemporary life was great; he doubted, he rationalised and he tried to protect his upended sensibilities with humour. The horror movie references were brilliant. 
 The writing was fantastic. This is my first Charlie Cochet, but it definitely won't be my last! From the balance between detail, description and plot, to the showing not telling and the beautiful imagery they managed throughout the story, everything was so crystal clear that I felt like I stepped into another world for the time I was reading. 
 The humour was excellent. I laughed aloud more than once, had a good giggle when appropriate and was still able to cry and feel my throat tightening up at those dramatic, heart-wrenching scenes. 
 As for the other characters, I really loved how standoffish Khalon was to begin with and how Riley slowly melted the icy barrier aroudn his heart. The chemistry between those two was fantastic. As was the beautiful, but still heartbreaking, chemistry between Toka and Rayner. I most definitely need their book next. Immediately! 
 ~ 
 For a short story, it really packs a punch. I can't wait to read more of the series, to see how Riley and Khalon settle in together and watch them grow, while learning about new characters. And, hopefully, revisiting Toka and Rayner.

 Favourite Quotes 
 \"There was a good chance the lemon cake he ate was somehow laced with LSD and he was high as a fucking kite, grinning like an idiot and sitting on the cafe counter stuffing baked goods into his mouth. One could only hope.\" 
 \"This was it. It was all over. Riley shut his eyes tight. He regretted not having been able to clear his browser history. Sorry, Mom. I wasn't disturbed, I swear. Okay, maybe a little.\" 
 \"I am Khalon, king of the Soldati, and I am your mate.\" Saying the words alone pained him greatly. 
 \"Hey, if you want to be friends, that's cool, but friends don't kidnap each other or chain each other up. Okay, maybe some do, but why don't we start small? Maybe grab a cup of coffee instead? 
 Khalon stopped pacing. \"What?\" 
 \"You said you were my mate. Are you British, a little Australian, maybe? I can't make out the accent.\" 
 \"I am neither. Why would you assume as much?\" Khalon waved a hand in dismissal. \"Never mind.\" It was quite possible the man was an idiot. \"I meant mate as in lover. Partner. You are fated to rule and hunt at my side as my prince.\" 
 \"Whoa.\" Riley let out a laugh and held his shackled wrists up before him. \"Let's not get ahead of ourselves. You chain up all your dates? On second thought, don't answer that.\"\"",eng,1,Sat Nov 12 03:02:47 -0800 2016,book the soldati prince soldati hearts number author charlie cochet star rating no of pages number cover gorgeous pov

98,002bdf47502cfecb548f266f70b2f274,26046339,The Woman Next Door,5231272,Yewande Omotoso,002a023d3de233b4bd3ec4fc3e9c581a,5,"This is one of those literary fiction novels where the main characters are female. And it's about the subtleties of how women relate to each other. Especially from different social, economic and cultural backgrounds. 
 Marion and Hortensia are both strong women. They've had successful businesses. Have opinions and not afraid to state them or stand up for them. Both are strong willed and sometimes stubborn. Hortensia especially so. 
 They've been living next door to each other in a suburb of Cape Town, South Africa for going on 20 years. And have had a bitter feud for the whole time. 
 As the novel begins, both are now retired. Have little to do with their days which means the feuding is even stronger than ever. 
 Yet... eventually everything must change and it begins in this novel with their husbands dying only a short period apart from each other. The deaths are the rocks thrown into the pond and now their lives are rippling... and crossing each other. 
 It's very well written. I really appreciated the subtle insights given to the characters. Like this one: 
 \"The problem with shame, Marion thought to herself, is that it breeds unproductivity. It is such a crippling thing.\" 
 Another one: 
 \"They ate and Hortensia thought about how intimate eating with someone was. How you might not ever really know a person until you took soup with them, listened to them slurp or try not to slurp, listened to them swallow.\" 
 In the small details that we take for granted, Yewande has reaped interesting new insights and perspectives. 
 For me, Yewande has become another author to watch for. 
 Highly recommended. Easy 5 stars from me. 
 Thank you to the publisher for the free copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.","",11,Sat Apr 16 15:07:57 -0700 2016,this is one of those literary fiction novels where the main
